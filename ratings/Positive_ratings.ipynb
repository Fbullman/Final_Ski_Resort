The result is fantastic grooming, lifts that run and the best food values of any Montana resort (check out the fresh rolls, cookies, soups, entrees).  The beginner area is perfect for kids and viewing parents.  There’s a full range of runs including a double-diamond backside for the deepest days and more steeply inclined.

However,  the runs are fairly short in comparison, especially on the steeper back side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.002250\n",

              "There are not words to describe how much I enjoy this place.  First off, it is absolutely massive.  You like groomers? There's tons.  Steeps?  Trees? Tons of that too.  I gave the terrain park 4 stars only because when I was there this year, they were just getting the fishbowl opened and there was just maybe a dozen very small features packed at the bottom of the run where the park is.  I was kind of disappointed because I thought there was enough snow to have done much more, but I know that once they get the thing built, it's pretty good.  Honestly though, as much as I like riding park, there are so many other places to have fun on Big Mountain that it didn't bother me in the least.  The weather can be a bit challenging, but like they say, snow comes from clouds, so what are you gonna do?  There are also plenty of nice places to eat or have beers, and overall, I didn't think the food was overly expensive.  Certainly no more expensive that stuff at our local places in Western NY and PA.  I definitely recommend going straight to be back of the mountain.  Great runs and still no lift lines.  The Bigfoot T-Bar is also a fun place to hang out when it's open.  I stayed with a family member in Kalispell, so I can't really speak to accommodations and/or nightlife, but the town of Whitefish is great and has tons of cool bars and good spots to eat (Buffalo Cafe and Great Northern were great).  Full disclosure - I'm from Northeast Ohio, so if you live in Utah or Colorado or something, maybe you wouldn't love it as much as I did, but I doubt it.  I've also been to Okemo, and while Okemo is great, Whitefish puts it to shame.  The vast amount of terrain and complete lack of lift lines make it great for anyone.  If you're an east-coaster or Midwesterner looking to head out west, I highly, highly recommend checking out Whitefish.  Oh, and if you want cheap lift tickets and have a Costco membership, the one in Kalispell sells lift for like 50 bucks.  Oh, and the staff are some of the friendliest people on the planet, especially the lifties.    0.002250\n",

              "Lines tend be non existent here, lift tickets and housing are affordable and the terrain is as good as any mountain in the country.  It’s clear that the original layout of the mountain lift system was not well though out 50 years ago.  However, we’ve been coming here for more than fifteen years and have witnessed great upgrades to the mountain lift system by current ownership. I also hear there are many more upgrades in process. The addition of the flower point chair and moving chair 5 to the east rim area were huge improvements. Thank you!  I’ve heard of upgrades to the Hellfire area and I hope they are considering upgrades to the right side (as you look up the mountain from the bottom) of the mountain as well.  Russ’s street might be the longest catwalk in the country so I’m hoping they find a way to reduce that trek by providing lift service to the top from that side of the mountain.  The fog can quite bad here but tree skiing helps and there are plenty of gladed areas around Flower Point.  You can’t beat the lodging prices at the mountain. They are a fraction of what you might pay in Colorado.  There’s not much by the mountain at night besides a small bar at the base lodge and Ed and Mully’s at the bottom of chair three.  The town has several great restaurants but it is a good 15 minute drive away. overall, we love this mountain and look forward to seeing the new upgrades.  It has its trade offs but the pros far outweigh the cons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.002250\n",

              "The road up is not as bad as people will lead you to believe. Just go a little slower and pull over to let people pass if you need to, no biggie. \\n\\nWhen this mountain gets snow, oh man is it good. I've had several days where I should have brought a snorkel. I cry myself to sleep nightly at the thought of all the amazing pow-plastered selfies I could have had if I had only grown my beard sooner. The tree skiing and \"freestyle\" terrain you can get into up here is pretty intense. \\n\\nThe problem is that this mountain does not always have the snow. If it's been a while since the last storm rock skis are going to be a must. The summit is generally better than the base, like every mountain on earth, but even the bottom of the top lift turns into gravel pretty quickly. \\n\\nThe bowl run-out is also lacking, as it is a steep ravine. I'm in pretty decent shape and have been skiing most of my life, but I dread coming out of the bottom of the bowls. \\n\\nThis mountain is not for you if you are not a confident skier or are a beginner. While there are easier runs, you will get much better value out of a mountain like Discovery or Blacktail. \\n\\nThe bar at the bottom makes some of the best pizza I've ever had in my life, and even if you don't ski (or mountain bike in the summer) I recommend you come and enjoy the food if nothing else. \\n\\nOverall this is one of my favorite mountains just because it has this charm to it, and also those pow face-shots I missed out on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.002250\n",

              "Listen, this is a family ski area, notice I didn’t say resort! It’s not Vail or Aspen, Snowbird, or Big Sky! But that’s what I like about Red Lodge and also how people are able to afford taking their family’s and having a great time. Don’t get me wrong, I liked skiing at Aspen and Snowbird, with their 60 man tramway! It’s just a different experience and I love the townspeople at Red Lodge as well. Just normal folks, you probably won’t see the Kardashians there or Kanye and that suits me just fine. You can go to Jackson for that!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.002250\n",
              "We probably picked a bad time to come. The crowds were insane. By early afternoon, the snow was starting to get packed and rutted. The staff seemed overwhelmed and overworked. Did I mention the crowds? If you stayed on the upper parts of the hill, you were rewarded with better skiing and slightly less hostil crowds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0.002250\n",

              "Our family spent a wonderful day at the ski resort. We had tons of fun and the weather was wonderful. After skiing for a few hours we went inside the lodge to have lunch. The guys cooking were hilarious and got our food to us in a timely manner. However, the lady at the cash register was suprisingly rude and had no patience what so ever. We encountered her later when we sat at the coffee bar and she made eye contact with me but made no movement to leave the kitchen to tend to us. This was the only disappointment of our entire day. All the guys running the ski lifts were entertaining and accommodating to people's needs. Overall, a good time even for its small size!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.002250\n",

              "Just got back from our 5th annual family trip to Red Lodge.  We keep coming back because we love the skiing, love the prices and it is the closest mountain skiing from Minnesota.  It is advertised as Montana skiing pure and simple.  Nothing fancy at all.  No lines, no attitudes and lots of common folks having fun skiing.  The parking lot is filled with pickup trucks and family vans. The best skiing and fastest lifts are on the Cole Creek side of the mountain.  My family loves this place!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.002250\n",
              "Bridger Bowl is the quintisential gem in the rough. This is definately a local hill, and it caters to people who love to go big and have fun but could definately pass on the leather couches and 5 martini lunches in some five star restaurant. Bridger has absolutely fantastic advanced terrain and great expert terrain for those who would be willing to hike the ridge. The only problem is that they require you to have an avalanche transciever, even though it's only about 500' from the top of the lift to the top of the ridge. You can rent one, but I was cheap. I should have splurged because the pickings up there looked pretty darn good. However, you will find no shortage of lift served challenges here. The only major downside to this place other than its lack of ammenities (for those who need em), is the terrain park, which is next to nonesistant. However, since the whole mountain is essentially a huge terrain park, you won't necessarilly be wanting for air. Go jump off some rocks, because there are plenty with nice pillowy soft powder landings. This mountain is definately best for young 20somethings who want to hit it big and go party in a collge town after its all said and done.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if you are a flatlander looking for a family vacation, you might want to go with Big Sky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.001125\n",
              "I think maybe RLM should of put that Back 40 detatchable chair right in front of the Stube. When the Midway Express chair is down it really sucks to half to go all the way to the bottom and ride that 15 min. chair that all the dweebs ride just to get back to the Grizzly Peak chair. When I was there the week of 3/17/08 they had 6\" of new snow one day and 5\" the next and still never ran that Back 40 detatchable anyway. Never the less, don't tell anyone about RLM.

Looking forward to returning in 2013.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0.001125\n",

              "We skied over Xmas 2011 since not enough to open all lift we got tickets for $20! For us, we are beginner/intermediate skiers so the lifts that were open were perfectly fine for us. Plus two beautiful lodges to eat lunch in. What a hidden gem this ski resort is. Not too crowded, no wait on the ski lifts.

              "We skied Bridger Bowl twice while staying at Big Sky because the weather was not cooperating with producing snow cover. While we were skiing over rocks at Big Sky, Bridger Bowl was almost completely open with about the same snow cover. The staff was very friendly and the early season rates were very good. There is a good variety of terrain to choose from and no crowds. Bridger Bowl is an easy drive from Bozeman which allows for more of a variety of lodging to choose from.

              "On February 17 a group of 44 middle school students from Frank Brattin Middle School in Colstrip made a ski trip to Red Lodge Mountain. Annalee was instrumental in organizing this trip, the guys in the rental shop were great and got the kids checked in and out the door in record time. We had many first time skiers and snowboarders. After their lesson they were set loose to ski and snowboard and had a really good day. Our more experienced skiers and snowboarders took advantage of the nice day and spent the entire time on the mountain. A great day was had by all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.001125\n",

              "Purchased all day ski passes online in advance. In theory this should’ve saved time upon arrival. This was the biggest downside of our day at Bridger Bowl. We waited for close to 2 hours to get the passes and rent equipment. Now for the praise: one of our sons got sick after I paid for his equipment and pass. I visited the ski services area and spoke to a manager who transferred his day pass and equipment rental to a different day. The staff also helped us after learning my husband was in a car wreck on his way to pick up two of us, and our shoes were in the damaged vehicle! They found us some lost and found shoes so we didn’t have to wear socks off property that night. My son and I took the bus service from the ski area to the Bozeman fair grounds and got an Uber from there back to our hotel in Bozeman. Beautiful ski area for all ski levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.001125\n",

              "The Big Mountain (as all locals still call it) is a true gem in a world of generic fake plastic jewelry. Yes there is only 1 high speed lift on the front side of the mtn. but that 1 lift accesses almost all of the terrain so why add more? Yes it can be very foggy but there is an unlimited number of tree runs to combat the lack of visibility. I'm not sure how anybody could end up on cat-tracks everywhere they went (granted that there is one very long road to return to the front side lifts from the North Bowl) as most of the runs are long, long, long! (some drop up to 2500 vertical feet) The groomers do an outstanding job of providing nothing but the best corduroy...and when it snows...oh baby is it good! It has been known to rain but then again all but the highest resorts run a risk of rain. I've seen it rain to 10,000 feet in Utah in January. The base village is OK but after the apres ski scene dies down there is absolutely nothing to do, hence the town of Whitefish. The genuine friendliness that you will encounter cannot be bought at any other resort. Don't miss a chance to try some other activities in the area: dog sledding, x-country skiing, snowshoeing, a side trip to Glacier National Park.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0.001125\n",
              "Recently visited Bridger Bowl on 3/10 after having just been to Big Sky for skiing the previous week. I must say I was impressed. Although it is no Big Sky, it is a perfect place to spend the day skiing. No lines, nice powder, and pretty decent trail map. The staff from the ticket counter to the lodge restaurant bar are friendly.\\n\\nAnd - God forbid you do - but if you get hurt the ski patrol is experienced, prepared and super supportive. I had a mishap (broke my tibia) and Rob came to my rescue - he was awesome at keeping me calm and getting me to realize I needed an ambulance ride instead of my friend driving me to the ER. He held my leg in position until the medics got there and talked me through the pain.\\n\\nThey called to follow up on me two times the first week and sent me a get well card.\\n\\nI will definitely visit next year!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.001125\n",
