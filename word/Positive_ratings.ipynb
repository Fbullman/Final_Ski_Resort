Yesterday (Saturday) Lift lines were non-existent, skied into the lift every time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.002250\n",

              "The road up is not as bad as people will lead you to believe. Just go a little slower and pull over to let people pass if you need to, no biggie. \\n\\nWhen this mountain gets snow, oh man is it good. I've had several days where I should have brought a snorkel. I cry myself to sleep nightly at the thought of all the amazing pow-plastered selfies I could have had if I had only grown my beard sooner. The tree skiing and \"freestyle\" terrain you can get into up here is pretty intense. \\n\\nThe problem is that this mountain does not always have the snow. If it's been a while since the last storm rock skis are going to be a must. The summit is generally better than the base, like every mountain on earth, but even the bottom of the top lift turns into gravel pretty quickly. \\n\\nThe bowl run-out is also lacking, as it is a steep ravine. I'm in pretty decent shape and have been skiing most of my life, but I dread coming out of the bottom of the bowls. \\n\\nThis mountain is not for you if you are not a confident skier or are a beginner. While there are easier runs, you will get much better value out of a mountain like Discovery or Blacktail. \\n\\nThe bar at the bottom makes some of the best pizza I've ever had in my life, and even if you don't ski (or mountain bike in the summer) I recommend you come and enjoy the food if nothing else. \\n\\nOverall this is one of my favorite mountains just because it has this charm to it, and also those pow face-shots I missed out on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.002250\n",

              "There are not words to describe how much I enjoy this place.  First off, it is absolutely massive.  You like groomers? There's tons.  Steeps?  Trees? Tons of that too.  I gave the terrain park 4 stars only because when I was there this year, they were just getting the fishbowl opened and there was just maybe a dozen very small features packed at the bottom of the run where the park is.  I was kind of disappointed because I thought there was enough snow to have done much more, but I know that once they get the thing built, it's pretty good.  Honestly though, as much as I like riding park, there are so many other places to have fun on Big Mountain that it didn't bother me in the least.  The weather can be a bit challenging, but like they say, snow comes from clouds, so what are you gonna do?  There are also plenty of nice places to eat or have beers, and overall, I didn't think the food was overly expensive.  Certainly no more expensive that stuff at our local places in Western NY and PA.  I definitely recommend going straight to be back of the mountain.  Great runs and still no lift lines.  The Bigfoot T-Bar is also a fun place to hang out when it's open.  I stayed with a family member in Kalispell, so I can't really speak to accommodations and/or nightlife, but the town of Whitefish is great and has tons of cool bars and good spots to eat (Buffalo Cafe and Great Northern were great).  Full disclosure - I'm from Northeast Ohio, so if you live in Utah or Colorado or something, maybe you wouldn't love it as much as I did, but I doubt it.  I've also been to Okemo, and while Okemo is great, Whitefish puts it to shame.  The vast amount of terrain and complete lack of lift lines make it great for anyone.  If you're an east-coaster or Midwesterner looking to head out west, I highly, highly recommend checking out Whitefish.  Oh, and if you want cheap lift tickets and have a Costco membership, the one in Kalispell sells lift for like 50 bucks.

Great fun otherwise for the whole family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.002250\n",
              "Discovery is a wonderful small ski area run by folks who really know what they’re doing.  The result is fantastic grooming, lifts that run and the best food values of any Montana resort (check out the fresh rolls, cookies, soups, entrees).  The beginner area is perfect for kids and viewing parents.  There’s a full range of runs including a double-diamond backside for the deepest days and more steeply inclined.  The views from the ski hill Are a mini Lake Tahoe with the Pintler Wilderness Peaks surrounding Georgetown Lake,  The drive from the north through cowboy land is peaceful and spectacular.  Overall, a great experience if you stay local or drive remotely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.002250\n",
              "Our family spent a wonderful day at the ski resort. We had tons of fun and the weather was wonderful. After skiing for a few hours we went inside the lodge to have lunch. The guys cooking were hilarious and got our food to us in a timely manner. However, the lady at the cash register was suprisingly rude and had no patience what so ever. We encountered her later when we sat at the coffee bar and she made eye contact with me but made no movement to leave the kitchen to tend to us. This was the only disappointment of our entire day. All the guys running the ski lifts were entertaining and accommodating to people's needs. Overall, a good time even for its small size!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.002250\n",

              "Just got back from our 5th annual family trip to Red Lodge.  We keep coming back because we love the skiing, love the prices and it is the closest mountain skiing from Minnesota.  It is advertised as Montana skiing pure and simple.  Nothing fancy at all.  No lines, no attitudes and lots of common folks having fun skiing.  The parking lot is filled with pickup trucks and family vans. The best skiing and fastest lifts are on the Cole Creek side of the mountain.  My family loves this place!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.002250\n",

Brownies are a must try as is the chili.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.002250\n",

              "Lines tend be non existent here, lift tickets and housing are affordable and the terrain is as good as any mountain in the country.  It’s clear that the original layout of the mountain lift system was not well though out 50 years ago.  However, we’ve been coming here for more than fifteen years and have witnessed great upgrades to the mountain lift system by current ownership. I also hear there are many more upgrades in process. The addition of the flower point chair and moving chair 5 to the east rim area were huge improvements. Thank you!  I’ve heard of upgrades to the Hellfire area and I hope they are considering upgrades to the right side (as you look up the mountain from the bottom) of the mountain as well.  Russ’s street might be the longest catwalk in the country so I’m hoping they find a way to reduce that trek by providing lift service to the top from that side of the mountain.  The fog can quite bad here but tree skiing helps and there are plenty of gladed areas around Flower Point.  You can’t beat the lodging prices at the mountain. They are a fraction of what you might pay in Colorado.  There’s not much by the mountain at night besides a small bar at the base lodge and Ed and Mully’s at the bottom of chair three.  The town has several great restaurants but it is a good 15 minute drive away. overall, we love this mountain and look forward to seeing the new upgrades.  It has its trade offs but the pros far outweigh the cons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.002250\n",
              "Listen, this is a family ski area, notice I didn’t say resort! It’s not Vail or Aspen, Snowbird, or Big Sky! But that’s what I like about Red Lodge and also how people are able to afford taking their family’s and having a great time. Don’t get me wrong, I liked skiing at Aspen and Snowbird, with their 60 man tramway! It’s just a different experience and I love the townspeople at Red Lodge as well. Just normal folks, you probably won’t see the Kardashians there or Kanye and that suits me just fine. You can go to Jackson for that!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.002250\n",

              "We were attracted to Bridger for its impressive track record on sustainability and environmental friendliness. The prices are reasonable because Bridger is a co-op, and do not reflect in any way a lower quality slope. Fantastic variety of slopes from the easiest to most extreme. Fantastic instructors! If you go to ski for food, fashion and off-slope entertainment this is not your place. Make sure to take a trail map. as the trails are not marked in great detail. There is however a nice well marked \"easiest route down\" for those who need it. An excellent experience for very young children, (pre-K).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.001125\n",
              "There are several great cross country ski trails at the Ski Area. There is a separate parking area for cross country trails before you get to the main ski parking lot. This separate parking area allows access to trails on both sides of the road. Most of the trails were groomed as we skied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.001125\n",

This is just a real down to earth place, and often no lift lines. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.001125\n",

              "Had a three hour private lesson with Afton. I was nervous and a little embarrassed given I'm a young adult who didn't know a THING about skiing while all these little kids skied right by. But she made me feel very confident! She was incredibly nice and helpful, answering all my questions directly and really changing the plan to fit what I needed help with (for example, noting I needed more help turning back and forth so we focused on that). I'm not sure how the prices for packages & rentals compare ($57 for a day, $48 after noon, or $5 for the snowflake), but the ski lodge itself was pretty cheap. Obviously it doesn't cost to enter, but the food was good for the price! it's big and clean, which is really nice if you want to take a break from skiing. It has wifi, a cafeteria, a restaurant, and bar. They have everything you need for rentals--I got skis, poles, a helmet, and ski boots for $40 ($35 on Wednesday)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0.001125\n",

              "MT Snowbowl is a real skiers lost paradice. The terrain is steep deep and epic tree skiing. Great BC access for good snow any time of the year. I you want to see people that rip the whole mtn. and dont complain about weather and conditions this is the place. The two slow old dubble riblets chairs add to the charm and give your legs a well deserved break from shredding 2600 feet of vertical sick terrain. The bar at the bottom has the best wood stove cooked pizza you will find any were and a great seltion of beers on tap.  The locals and liftys are some of the coolest people you will find any ski area. dont let this mtn pass you up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.001125\n",

You usually can't go wrong with this destination for family fun!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.001125\n",
              "What is not to like?  Perfect snow, friendly folks, affordable prices and decent lines.  During the week and excluding the holidays, there are basically no crowds.  People are complaining about no apres-ski, but really downtown Whitefish has plenty of entertainment...  and what can be more entertaining than having a drink with friends after a long day of skiing around a log fire in one of the most beautiful places on Earth?  If you ask me, Whitefish Mountain Resort is a skier's paradise and I have been around.  It is a family resort, so maybe not for hipsters, even though I have seen plenty of youngsters enjoying the snow.  It used to be really popular with Canadians when their dollar went further and if anyone knows about snow... :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.001125\n",

Food quality in Bierstube has gone down a little and consistently raised prices and you still have to deal ski racers completing and practicing whenever they want taking up chunks of intermediate terrain.
