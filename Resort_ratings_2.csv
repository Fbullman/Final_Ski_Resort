Loads of different drinks, no matter if you are cold, or warm.\nThere is a pro shop downstairs, but be prepared to spend a pretty penny for anything there.\nI would recommend that Showdown keeps any eye on the dining area.

I had no interest in learning to ski and the instructor did not seem to have the patience for kids. My best friend and I got annoyed and snuck away from lessons and spent the day in the lodge eating and reading by the fire. 15 years later, one of my friends convinced me to learn to snowboard. I took my small car with myself and 3 other people, 3 boards (I was renting one there) and all of our snow gear up the mountain in the biggest blizzard of the season. We had a blast and I was lucky enough to get a personalized one-on-one lesson as not many people had braved the weather to head up there that day. The following season, I convinced my sister to take me with her family. A few of them did ski lessons and my bro-in-law and I hopped on snowboards.

RLM doesn't have the super gnarly runs that Jackson Hole or Big Sky have but it still has a wide variety of terrain that will satisfy just about anyone and also doesn't cost an outrageous amount for a lift ticket. The food is better than average and not as expensive as other pricier ski areas. The staff is always friendly and helpful, especially the Mountain Hosts who help get your kids to ski school, help unload your vehicle and even carry bags and skis for you. This is a good place for families and the ski school does an excellent job with kids. The only real downside is that there are no lodging facilities at the mountain but the town of Red Lodge is only 6 miles away and there are several motels and good restaurants in town.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Great choice on our part even though we drove 770 miles from Sioux Falls, SD. For me as long as Red Lodge has the snow I will gladly make it an annual trek. \n\nThe staff at the resort were fantastic, everyone from ticket sales to lift ops were friendly and helpful. \n\nThe ski chow was great and not overpriced. This was truly a mom and pop, old fashioned down to resort. \n\nAs an intermediate skier, the terrain was all I could ask for, the variety of runs was awsom. My son (a ski instructor), was more than content with the variety of terrain. \n\nThe snow, dry fluffy powder, wow!!\n\nI'll be back...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-12,4,"We went to RLM because they had the most snow of all the Montana ski hills within 1 days drive of our home in Alberta Canada.

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,,4,This is one of the most gorgeous drives in Montana. The views are amazing! A must see!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-11,5,"We drove out from Minneapolis over the Christmas week 2011. \n\nThis place has a monster rise off the local terrain. We had stopped in Billings on the way out to buy discount lift tickets - adults at $42 rather than $49, (college kids get them for $32 at the hill), and could see not only the hill but the runs from the edge of Billings - 50 miles away. The town of Red Lodge is at 5500 ft, the plains below probably at 4000 ft or less, so the view from the top was huge. You could see the Crazy mountains and I'm quite sure the Bridger range to the west. Behind were the peaks and high plateau of the bear tooth range - spectaular. The ski hill peaks are at 9700, chalet base is 7700, but the palisade area drops another 400' for the advertised 2400' vert. But the impressive part is it's 2000 ft straight down. Two main runs run from top to bottom, one is black diamond (upper and lower limited), the other intermediate (lazy M) (but in the midwest it would also be black diamond). All of us went down Lazy M, but it isn't lazy. You wouldn't be able to bomb it - and the limited, which is groomed - would get you up around a hundred if you tucked and kept your feet. That run, if left ungroomed would be a 2 mile mogul run all the way down. Even the beginner lift, Miami beach, has a grade like an intermediate run and is tilted to the fall line, so isn't the best for beginners, but is a full 300 ft in elevation. Our daughters spent much time on that run. The only true beginner area is right out front the chalet in the wide ravine though which all the runs eventually funnel to the main lower lift. The Miami beach area is in it's own side ravine. The main area has a long magic carpet off the north side and a roped area for beginners and lessons. Good area for true beginners. It was packed. \n \nFive days before we arrived they got 2 feet of snow. Three days before our arrival temps got up into the 40s. We saw little powder, almost all hard packed power, and a touch of the hard stuff. Conditions were actually very good and what we like to ski, but I was surprised it settled and got knocked down so fast. This hill was completely open, base of 4' +, nothing else in the West as far as I know was even 75% open at this time, so folks normally running off to Big Sky for the day or Bridger were here. The parking lot is small for ski area size and cars were parked on the side of the access road going a full mile down the road. My wife had an old guy sit with her for a while and said normally the top lot is only half full. Yet in spite of having record crowds, and mostly older lifts, there were no real lift lines. Even on day 2 when they closed the upper lifts due to wind, my son and I took the willow lift multiple times - no lines. An exception to this was the Miami beach lift which ran at a snails pace had a long line and the high speed quad in the palisades area had a bit of a line. The main triple lift flies along, they have a sign in front telling you you'll get knocked on your can if you don't pay attention. \n \nMy son and I skied much on the front side and Latigo in the Cole Creek area. Again very steep grade for an intermediate run. His gps showed a 1000+ ft drop in about a mile. I skied true grit (double black) once - steep with mostly shallow bumps..And of course there was a family of 4 going down it - mom, dad, sister and little sister - about age 5. Not sure what their motivation was - at their rate they were going to get just one run in. Our second time down this area we took the trail that goes to the bottom of the palisades. My son said it was the best trail he's ever been on. Dangerous weaving thing, hard to keep the speed down. Other great mogul runs were Berrys, Thompsons' and Royals run. Even on the lower level of the hill off the side of the main ridge, they had runs like Bigfoot and Bear paw that longer bump runs than most in the Midwest. \n \nBest part of the hill is the terrain, from looking at google earth and the tail map, I underestimated the size and topography. It's much larger, steeper, and varied than I expected. Ridges, valleys and heavily treed. Much more interesting terrain than Solitude and Winter Park, and from what I remember of Keystone and A-basin. Similar but obviously smaller, yet more challenging than Snowmass. The Drainage area looked cool from the chair but not like the map... it's just tree skiing in a really steep gorge. I didn't try it. \n \nShort comings? Lower parking is 50 ft below upper parking. Upper parking is 20 ft below the chalet. Step out of the undersized Chalet, and you have to walk up 12 ft of hill to get to either of the lift lines. Had they not flattened out the area for the parking, they could have continued the runs down another 500 feet into the ravine. They're short of flat areas. Instead of fanning out onto flats, it all funnels in to a congested, overly steep area. I didn't mind, nor did our kids, but not an easy place for beginners. The upper chalet was very nice. Day 2 we stopped in early - almost empty. Next we stopped at noon, jam packed, but again the weather went from calm, sunny and 35 in the morning to maybe 40 mph gusts midday. \n \nThe entire area is in a national forest with limited base facilities for the size of the hill. Sort of like Lutsen on a busy day. They did put in 2 high speed quads in sometime ago - for Cole creek and Palisades, but in my opinion they should have used the Palisade quad (not always in use) and used it to serve the base area, and moved dirt around to make base area more friendly. Also there is no on site lodging so it's a ski hill - not a resort. I imagine the locals would want it to stay the way forever. Limited older lodging in town, inconvenient for beginners, no glamour. In return they get great cheap skiing. I'd go back for another look. Can't say the same for three of the other places I've been to in the last few years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-20,3,"If you're going to compare this to other Rocky Mt resorts you will be very disappointed. If you compare this to mid-west hills you will be pretty happy. If you compare this to east coast hills you will be ""meh, not what I expected the rockies to offer"". So with that said and your expectations adjusted lets talk about the mountain itself. Several nice long on-piste groomers, some nice hidden tree runs that get run out fairly quickly and a couple runs for your newbies and kids but not much to offer for the true beginner. That said the mountain and terrain gets a passing grade of a C. Now for the amenities and lodge/ food etc.. I was almost shocked at the lack of a comfortable place to take a break. The lodge is tiny and dated with one dirty bathroom for the entire resort! The food is a typical cafeteria style with limited options and poor quality. There was a mexican option in a yurt that was even a worse option than the typical hot water burgers and fries drenched in canned cheese. The trip up to the hill is long and windy, the parking is below grade, the rental shop had 5 to 6 yr old skies but were fairly efficient given the amount of people. The people however were great and friendly. The town and stay and eat options are limited and most fall below standard other than a few select places. Do yourself a favor and review everything or ask someone whom has been before you blindly chose your destination for a room or food. In closing; I will return in summer but I will question driving 500 miles again to visit the ski resort unless some major improvements are announced. Oh I forgot lift! They still get you up the hill in 50 yr old double chairs and the main chair is a triple that you sit on for 15 minutes! Wow..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-20,1,"The mountain seems nice but unfortunately one staff member ruined our experience. My girlfriend and I have tried to snowboard a couple of times in the past but neither of us had even taken a lesson. It had also been a few years before our last attempt. We were in Red Lodge visiting friends for the weekend and we all thought it would be fun to take advantage of the snow by going up to snowboard. Since my girlfriend and I hadn't been in a few years and had never taken a lesson we decided to take advantage of the lesson and rental package the mountain offers. Our instructor, Mitch, was nice enough. During our lesson we had told him we had tried to snowboard a couple of times in the past but had never taken a lesson. After he gave us some basics he took us over to the lift. Once we were there we were berated by another staff member. I believe his name was Craig. He yelled at us because we had tried snowboarding in the past (we assume Mitch informed him when we arrived to the lift) and said we should not have purchased the package. He told us twice that we needed to quit purchasing that deal as if we had done so in the past. He said it was for first timers only and that they have more intermediate lessons for a higher price that we should have paid. It was a little embarrassing and made us feel we did something wrong. Mitch did apologize for his co-worker after we got off the lift but we were still a bit frustrated. After leaving and re-visiting the website we believe we purchased the correct package. I have copied and pasted directly from their website:\n\n""Beginner lessons are perfect for first-time skiers and snowboarders of all ages, and for those who need a little extra work on the basics (turning or stopping). Our learning area and easy-to-ride Magic Carpet provide a safe and fun place to get started.\n\nAll beginner lesson packages include:\n\n1 Miami Beach Lift ticket\n90 minutes of group instruction\nEquipment rentals""\n\nWe definitely needed help with stopping and turning and struggle with falling. Craig needs to review their own policies and not berate paying patrons. His attitude and actions soured our visit. I don't foresee returning here and spending our money when there are much friendlier options. Our friends also mentioned that the season passes have almost doubled in the last few years. Seems like other places are also cheaper. Save your money and visit and more cost effective mountain with friendlier staff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First is the Main Lodge where they cook Hamburgers, Hot Dogs, Soup, Nachos, Cheese Fries and a ton more things which are very good but it does get very expensive because a Cheese Burger costs $6.50. The second place to eat is the Bierstube which has a huge bar and is a more adult friendly environment. Lastly is the Midway Lodge which is right off of the Midway Ski Lift. If you are looking to have a good time in Red Lodge I would highly recommend that you at least visit the mountain once.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr-12,4,"We had a great time skiing over the Easter weekend! It snowed while we were there, so the conditions were great for their last weekend. They also had a variety of runs for all the ability levels in our group. It was not very busy the first day--no lines, plenty of room. Saturday &amp; Sunday were considerably busier, but still manageable. We will return next year!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-12,4,"This year has been very exceptional for snow at Red Lodge, but I have always enjoyed the mountain. Had not gone skiing in 17 years, and my 2 teenage sons had never been, so it was time to go again. All of us had a great time, instructors for kid's and wife's lessons were great, lots of people learning that day, so they quickly brought in more instructors.\nThe mountain is really nice, has a mid mountain lodge that serves food also, so a trip to the bottom for lunch or a snack is not necessary. The biggest problem is no lift from bottom of mountain to top of mountain, have to ride 2 chairlifts, and takes some time. But, if you want to stay on the top half of the mountain, always short lift lines at upper chair lift. \n \nNew terrain has opened in the past few years, and really has expanded the mountain. Reasonable lift tickets at $49.00, and lessons, rentals, and lift tickets (beginner lift only) also for $49.00 each. Town is only 10-15 minutes away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-12,4,What a great place to ski! Terrain for all abilities and fun for the whole family! We'll definitely be back next year!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-12,3,We went to Red Lodge Mountain and enjoyed 2 great days of skiing.The staff at the ski area were so upbeat and helpful. The burgers were awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-21,2,"We skied her because we have the Indy Pass. The ski area was much bigger than expected. The snow was very good. The slopes are not crowded. It was a great experience having good, big skiing and not having to sit in a lift line.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-21,3,"My daughter and I are advanced skiers. The rest of the family is more intermediate but they stayed behind.\n\nLifts\nMain lifts are slow and older. You have to take to chair lifts to summit. They have nicer lifts in the back but they run them slow.\n\nFacilities\nAgain, older. This is a small resort. Do not expect shopping, lots of food and drink. The parking lots are gravel and rough. You need to take steps from the lower lot. These are not necessarily bad things but you need to expect that this more of a local hill.\n\nScenery \nBeautiful views and terrain. Some really pretty rock formations and forests on the backside.\n\nSkiing\nThe stuff that matters. I have to state the snow conditions were end of year. The week after we left they had multiple powder days. While we were there the snow was getting thin and half the trails were very icy. Some of the most icy I have skied. I live and ski regularly in the midwest and we know icy. \nI would not take my intermediate family members to this hill. The groomed runs are short. There is only one good intermediate run from. The summit...Lazy M. The remainder are black and double black, mostly ungroomed. Lots of bumps. My daughter and I worked on our bump skiing all week. The runs are on the thinner side. \n\nSummary\nThis is a skiers mountain. Beautiful scenery, advanced skiing, slow and older facilities...NO CROWDS! Town is great with good food. I wish the snow conditions would have been better...but that is spring!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-21,1,"We travelled from Minnesota to meet family and ski at Red Lodge Mountain. The first day the lift to get up to the top half of the mountain was broken so we could only ski on the bottom half - so we kind of only got half our money's worth (and the prices are getting steep).\n\nThe second morning, my cousin's wife ran afowl of the covid rules by going inside the lodge with her toddler to get out of the snow and warm up (you are supposed to wait in your car all day down in the parking lot) and they were kind of harsh with her about it. So at lunch when my cousin came in and heard about it, he went and told the guy ""don't treat my wife that way"" and a few heated words were exchanged and they could have just left it at that - but they didn't. Soon after, as they were eating, another guy came up and told my cousin and his family and his brother, who wasn't even involved but happened to be sitting with them, to get out - they couldn't ski anymore. They couldn't even finish their overpriced food. It all felt very vindictive.\n\nTo be fair, most of the employees were nice enough and the skiing was pretty good. But it just rubbed me the wrong way that they would pick a fight with a young mother trying to keep her toddler warm and then kick their family out along with a brother that wasn't even involved. Their zeal for covid seems to be overriding any kind of reason or compassion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-21,1,"After purchasing a two day pass, and then realizing after only 10 mins that my group only did day passes I tried to get a refund on just 1 and it was turned down. Can‚Äôt go again as I‚Äôm out of state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-21,3,"My teenage son and my brother and I did a holiday break ski trip through Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota, mostly hitting the little independent places. We stayed in Jackson but skied Snow King and Grand Targhee instead of Jackson Hole. We skied the Tetons, the Bighorns, the Black Hills and Red Lodge. Of all of that, our two days in Red Lodge was my favorite.\n\nI was concerned that the lack of snow was going to severely limit what was available. Nope. True, two of the lifts were closed, but from what I understand that's not unusual... I've read that some seasons they don't open Palisades at all. But no matter. And I will confess that my skis were badly abused, but the terrain was so fun that I just needed to get into the less well covered portions of it.\n\nMy favorite terrain was accessed from the top of Grizzly lift. There were plenty of black diamond mogul runs from there, a popular cruiser called Lazy M, and a nice blue mogul run (Barriers). A really enjoyable non-stop summit-to-base was to dodge moguls and rocks down Barriers, then duck through the trees in Little Forest.\n\nIf you're looking for glamour, forget it. For me, I think that's what I liked about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-21,2,"It's no surprise that Red Lodge Mountain has been rapidly increasing their rates in the last 3+ years, but now they have a new money grab. Until a few weeks ago they had normal group lessons for the 4-6yr olds, but they just recently changed it to ""Learn to ski with your child"". This is the only way for your 4 to 6-year-old to receive a lesson. Regardless of whether you are a seasoned skier yourself, you now have to pay $59/$65 extra to accompany your child. Their website states ""This lesson program pairs you and your child with an instructor who will teach you how to safely and effectively ski with your little one, while also providing your child with new skills."" Impossible to teach me how to ""safely and effectively ski with your little one"" when he didn't speak to me or the other dad at all. If the sole reason for having the parent there is for COVID then why is the instructor picking my child up 1/3 of the time. I understand making it mandatory for the parent to be there to assist but to charge the adult $59/$65 just to be there and to not receive any instruction on how to ""safely and effectively ski with your little one"" is completely ridiculous. The whole lesson was ridiculous. It was the instructor and just two children. The instructor didn't seem to want to be there. He barely spoke to the kids and gave them very little instruction. I don't think he even asked them their names or called them by name not even once. This is our 3rd time using the RLM ski school and our older child received excellent instruction on her previous classes in that same age range group lesson in previous years. It's a shame our 5-year-old had such a bad intro to skiing with this instructor. Hoping for a better experience next time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-20,3,Thank you Red Lodge Mountain! I feel so lucky that I am able to stay safe while skiing. Very appreciative of everyone at RLM who has worked so hard to keep everyone safe this winter and be able to open. I feel safe skiing here knowing that the mountain is following all COVID-19 protocols. Would recommend this place to anyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-20,4,"Very family friendly. Relaxing, great runs, The lazy M is a great run for everyone and fits everyone's ability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-20,1,Unsafe ski resort - stay away. I watched an entire chair fall of the lift today as two people were boarding. Luckily no one was hurt. The lift should have been closed for a safety inspection (duh!) after something like this happened. They re-attached the chair and started running it again right away. What would have happened if it came off when the people were 30 feet up in the air? It was really creepy to watch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Sep-20,3,"We loved exploring the lovely, charming and friendly town of Red Lodge. As a bonus we learned that the Highway had reopened after an early season snow storm, so we drove it to the scenic Vista. Spectacular views from every switch back, view point and turn in the rid. Beautiful mountain, and pretty streams in the meadow, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-16,3,"We skied at Red Lodge last week. Even though the warmer temps made for less than ideal skiing conditions, we have a good time. Everyone from the lift operators to restaurant workers to the ticket sellers were great. We will definitely be back!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-16,3,We really enjoyed the ease and convenience of our trip. Ski rental and purchase of lift tickets was fast and easy. No long waits at the lifts. Will definitely be visiting again. Only downside was number of runs open due to lack of natural snow as well as use of runs for competitive events that made them off limits to us and no fun to ski the day after. Very economical.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-16,4,"I love Red Lodge Mountain, and I get out there a few times each year. Great people, great town, fun mountain, and way cheaper than most other ski areas in the west.

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-16,5,Never met a more helpful and friendly group of people anywhere. Snow hasn't been great this season but all the staff had a great attitude. Beirstube is great for lunch or after the lifts close for a little unwinding after a day of snowboarding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-16,3,"The staff at red logde are absolutely wonderful.They are friendly and helpful. It has a small town feel. Snow could have been better, but can't control mother nature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-16,1,"The resort did not have much snow this year, but we were lucky enough to get one to 2 inches while there. Instead of letting everyone ski on it , however, they let it be groomed into a giant ice block. This reflects some very poor management I feel on the mountain, where skiing is not taken very seriously. I will probably only return when there is an abundance of snow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-16,3,"Red Lodge is quaint, the people are friendly, and the runs are well worth the drive. We snowboarder on Sunday and Monday and never waited for the lift.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-16,2,"Staff at Red Lodge Mountain are fantastic, as was the mountain itself. Was frustrating however that although totally understandable for patron safety the lifts were closed due to high winds until noon that once opened a little after 12:00 we still had to pay for the entire day even though we lost more than 3 hours of skiing time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-16,2,"Joined extended family for a ski/snowboard vacation at Red Lodge and left disappointed in the experience at Red Lodge Mountain. While the town of Red Lodge is very quaint and the people are extraordinarily nice, the mountain and runs are very lacking. First, for beginners like my youngest child, there were no good options. The one run that really caters to beginners (Miami Beach) was hampered by a chairlift that was shut down for a significant portion on two separate days and then was coaxed to work by skipping every other chair for at least three more days. Second, for intermediate skiers there are a few okay runs, but none of them were fantastic and many were very icy and seemed to be over-groomed. And this has been a fairly decent season weather-wise. There are a decent number of expert runs, but none of them were all that long. Again, the weather has been pretty good here this season so far, but there were very few runs that had good powder. They are hopeful to open a few more runs in the upcoming days, but that will do us no good. Our family took a day trip and went to Bridger Bowl just north of Bozeman (a 2-1/2 drive from Red Lodge) and were blown away by how much better that mountain was ... and the cost was the same. If you want to go on a nice ski vacation in Montana, there are many better options than Red Lodge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-16,4,"Not enough GREEN runs, and the BLUE runs were more difficult that expected. Be sure to ski (or board) ""Lazy-M"" - it became my favorite Lift attendants and staff at the lodge were helpful, freely gave assistance and were friendly!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-16,5,"This is a great mountain to ski on, the staff are always friendly and the runs are fun. I know this is more of a spring skiing place, when the snow hits there isn't a run you don't want to go on",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-16,5,No lift lines. All types of terrain. Incredible views. Reasonable prices. The snow was plentiful and the people are friendly. What more could you want?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-15,5,"This may sound bad, but we don't ski here as much as we used to. Typically, we stop now on the way out to Bozeman or Big Sky, or on the way home. There are not a lot of decent hotel choices that accommodate 5, and there are many places we used to stay that I wont go back to anymore. That does have an impact on us skiing here. The mountain itself struggles with snow - I would say only 4 times out of 20+ years have we skied the expansion territory - and it is some fun area to ski. That's not anyone's fault - just the way it is. When they get dumped on, there is nothing like it - it is a blast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-16,3,"Since ND had no snow, we went to Red Lodge. We got our lift tickets in advance &amp; skied a total of 7 the 3 weekends we were out there. The lift attendants were very professional &amp; courteous! Hard to find in this day &amp; age. The staff in the rental shop(skied w/one of them) &amp; the staff at the store were also great!. The ski instructors were always busy. I had thought about doing the learn &amp; earn package, that way they could get off the bunny hill &amp; do some skiing w/another ski instructor. But we didn't have time. The staff at the Midway Chalet were great &amp; the Staff at the Bierstube were always courteous. The ""Stube"" was always packed when we were there, &amp; the staff was always apologizing for our food taking so long. I have been in their shoes &amp; understand. We always thanked them &amp; told them we are ok &amp; not in a hurry. It put a couple of the waitresses at ease! kudos to Madeline for busting her buns the 3 weekends we were there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-13,4,"My wife and I went back to Red Lodge to ski after over 10 years. We had the best time.

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-13,4,"Food was cheap and the lift lines were next to nothing. Good local mountain - get there early so you don't have to walk a mile to the mountain.

The Midway Lodge is half way up the mountain and has good eats for a fair price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Oct-12,3,"Grew up on this mountain and love it just because it's the local place to hang out - you're constantly running into people you know. :) When it gets good snow, it's completely epic.

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-15,4,"The whole crew was excellent from the get go, from picking up our lift tickets purchased online, to the very streamlined equipment rental process and getting on the very first lift all the way to the last ride up and then the rental returns! Every employee we spoke to, or even passed by, was extremely freindly and very helpful. Even during the rush in the morning they did not get flustered or irritated, in fact it was quite the opposite, just took us all in stride and got us out the door! When we returned our gear and my fat belly prevented me from getting my boots off in a proffecient manner, one of the employees came over and gave me a hand with a smile. We were asked so many times ""How is the snow, how are you doing, are you enjoying the day?"" Every time we got on a lift we were told ""have a great run"" or "" enjoy it up there"". I am extremely impressed with the whole operation and highly recommend a day on the mountain at Red Lodge, the people make it great!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-14,4,"I was happy with my first experience of Red Lodge Mountain. Being a powder snob, I have not been to this resort before, as it usually gets less snow cover than other ski areas that I frequent in Montana. However, I was pleased this season with my spring snowboarding day here. Not only was it a blue sky fabulous day (although any day on the mountain is a good day :-P ), but the runs were long and face NE, so the snow stayed good until the bottom bit of the mountain, even though the sun was beating down.\n\nDid I say it had LOOONG runs? And the employees were great and the atmosphere was that of a little local ski area instead of a destination spot like Red Lodge. How cool is that?!!\n\nThanks for the end of my season Red Lodge Mountain. It was a stellar day, and I got to be with my sweetheart on top of it. Best snowboard day EVER! LOL",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-14,5,"The price was very good, the people very helpful and the skiing was perfect. My partner took a lesson, and that didn't work out too well, but figure that is on us, we should have signed up for a higher level.

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-14,3,"The line cooks don't understand how to cook more than a single order at a time. Forty minutes after we ordered our waitress assured us it would be ready in 'just a minute'. Ten minutes later, she assured us again. Five minutes later she brought us the hamburger, and then informed us the sausages had just been put on the grill. In total - one hour and five minutes to get a hamburger, two sausages and a cup of soup. Yes, the place was full and a few tables outside were occupied. Everyone seemed to be going through the same hostage scenario. I've worked as a line cook, a waiter, and bartender, so I know the capabilities and expectations of a kitchen, and this kitchen is totally incompetent. At the very, very least they should inform anyone wishing to order food how long they should expect to wait.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-13,5,"What an amazing place. The runs are really long. . . and really steep. We are used to skiing in Minnesota and this is a whole new level. It was an amazing experience. The blue hills are the equivalent to the black diamonds in Minnesota, though. The chalet is nice. Parking is great if you arrive when the rental/ticket office opens. Buy advanced tickets online and save a lot of money. If you rent for multiple days, you will need to decide if you want to keep the equipment or leave it overnight in a locker there. Overall, it was an amazing experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-13,3,Having enough snow can be an issue at any resort. RLM has more snow making equipment than any resort I've ever seen.

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Nov-14,2,"We skied Red Lodge Mountain on Thanksgiving weekend. There were hardly any lines but they had issues with lifts on a couple of different occasions. They have one high speed quad which was not open at the time of our visit. Group ski lessons were 1:1 instructor to student but no GPS device to see how much they've skied as they have at Winter Park, Colorado. The powder was deep. We sat on a broken lift for thirteen minutes in seriously cold weather. We were slightly perplexed at the lack of barricade on the dirt road leading to the mountain. There is no base lodge hotel, buildings are dated but there is a mid mountain dining spot and several buildings at the base that house rental shop, retail, and restaurants. At the mid-mountain lodge there was a significant collection of dead moths on the handrails leading to the bathroom however none ended up in our food. A beer here costs $4.75 and that's microbrew draft. Due to the fact that half the mountain was closed lift tickets were selling at the half day rate. Book two days for about $60 advance online and there are also good deals to be had at liftopia. Still, I find myself yearning for my favorite Colorado mountain with serious bumps, high speed lifts, and multiple dining options on the mountain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr-14,3,"Second consecutive year of skiing at Red Lodge and the hill continues to deliver. Diverse terrain - including some real steeps and challenging side-country skiing - along with long blues and greens; small numbers; friendly and helpful staff and locals; and real value. \n\nOh, and the snow is just the icing on the cake - simply epic at times. \n\nLiving in Manitoba, we still feel that the skiing at Red Lodge makes the drive down south of the border totally worthwhile. We'll definitely be back!\n\nTip: the lift ticket is already cheap but still look for the deals to be had at Liftopia.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul-14,3,"If you are in the area, don't pass up the drive to Red Lodge via the Beartooth pass. It is incredible and the town of Red Lodge is absolutely charming!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr-14,4,"I have never in my life have stepped into skis.. My fiance is a hard core skier and his friends (who are also big time skiers) invited us to come for the last weekend of skiing at Red Lodge (We live in South Dakota-although originally from Washington State). They encouraged me to take a ski lesson and I did! I was really nervous at first and was afraid of falling. I had a wonderful instructor named Mary who was very patient and helpful. By the end of the lesson I was doing some turns. Although I just stayed on the magic carpet ( I was way to tired at the end to try Miami Beach) I was very happy with the lesson and my progress. Mary was a WONDERFUL instructor!! Please pass that on! (I'm a teacher so I know what good teaching is like) It was a gorgeous day too so that helped. I tried it again the next day but it was snowy and more icy so I didn't feel as confident. I had a different instructor too. Still, I loved my experience at Red Lodge. My fiance loved it too and said it was some of the best skiing he's done-(especially after it dumped all that snow on Sunday!) We can't wait to come back next year!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-14,4,"We brought a small group from a small school. The mountain and skiing was great, the organization of the trip was a bit more stressful than need be. We tried to get a group rate ahead of time but we're told that they had ""too many"" groups for that two days and so no discounts. It was a bit crazy and $$ but we had a good time!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-15,3,"Groomers and power runs. Very nice lodge close to the summit, but unfortunately only open on weekends. Fortunately, the restrooms ARE open all days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-15,2,"Skied two days at Bridger Bowl, but knew that Red Lodge had received 17 inches of snow two days before, so decided to go there. Spent most of the time skiing the Palisades area. Great runs and a high speed lift. With the new snow, the rest of the ski area was great. If weather turns warm, they may lose snow fast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-15,3,"I have never been to Montana and had a few days off work so I decided to take myself snow boarding. I am a skier but want to learn snow boarding. The drive to Red Lodge was exciting; it is such beautiful country. Red Lodge is a quaint little town with many shops and places to eat. The drive up to Red Lodge Mountain from the town is also exciting. I was particularly fastinated by the sign that requires you to have snow chains or a vehicle that can navigate the steep, often snow laden passage. I realized why on my second day to the hill as I had to climb the mountain in very near white out conditions. Which only caused me to be more excited. Once at the lodge the staff were very helpful and attentive in getting my gear, rental, and onto the slopes. I went right to the Magic Carpet (bunny hill) as my lesson did not start for another hour. The Lift Attendant (aka: Liftie), Bob was so helpful in giving me pointers to get me started. Then, my lesson with Brianna was excellent. She helped me to form a good foundation. My second day on the slopes I went up the Miami Beach Lift. It was snowing the second day so that meant very different skiing conditions. But, the tools that Brianna gave me equipped me for all conditions. I look forward to continuing to snow board and hopefully soon be able to carve like Brianna. Thank you Red Lodge. You have great employees and you gave me a superb snow boarding experience. I look forward to coming back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-15,5,"We make it to Red Lodge every year! By far one of if not our favorite place to ski that we have visited. We skiied it twice this year and loved it again...the 2+ feet of fresh powder was amazing of coarse!! Great overall mountain with a little bit of everything, no matter what type of skier you are you shouldn't be disappointed! No lift lines and an excellent staff from ski patrol, resturant, and the gift shop employees make this a place I look forward to visiting year after year!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-15,5,"On February 17 a group of 44 middle school students from Frank Brattin Middle School in Colstrip made a ski trip to Red Lodge Mountain. Annalee was instrumental in organizing this trip, the guys in the rental shop were great and got the kids checked in and out the door in record time. We had many first time skiers and snowboarders. After their lesson they were set loose to ski and snowboard and had a really good day. Our more experienced skiers and snowboarders took advantage of the nice day and spent the entire time on the mountain. A great day was had by all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-15,5,Have been there twice this Winter and it has been wonderful both times. It is a Huge Mountain with a small lodge feel. We have been both times on a Friday/Saturday Trip and it is definetly a busy place on a Saturday. If you are a first timer to a bigger Mountain and need some space i would suggest going during the week. Also if you are on a Budget be sure to purchase your 'Super savers' Lift tickets ahead of time. The earlier you buy the more you save. Definetly eat at the Midway Chalet or the Beirstube. Skip the Cafeteria.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-15,5,Katie is an amazing employee! She helped make my visit to red lodge better than expected! Nature isn't always far for red lodge but employees like Katie make the trip worth it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-15,4,"We really, really loved skiing at Red Lodge! The days we were there, it hadn't snowed in forever and it was really warm. Two of the chairlifts and many of the ski runs were closed. But. BUT! The snow had really held up better than I had anticipated and we enjoyed some really great skiing on a wide variety of terrain in spring-like conditions. The snow was soft and fun. We spent a lot of time at the mid-mountain Chalet, too, where the food was better than most ski resorts I've been to! We had a blast on this mountain, and especially for the relatively low price of lift tickets, we left very happy and satisfied. This resort feels like a locals ski playground. I hope they never loose their small-town charm!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-15,4,Small Town Ski atmosphere. Great Skiing! Virtually no lift lines. Lower and mid-mountain chalets. Well groomed runs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-15,3,"My buddy and I decided that we werent going to hit the slopes the first day. My wife and her friend stll wanted to so we decided to go hit up the bar there. That place is FUN. The food was good but the beers and the environment were awesome. They even had the Packer/Seahawk game on. Next time we are in Red Lodge I am going to hit the slopes, which my wife told me was great. No chair lift wait times really. Only problem is that the power went out and the lifts stopped working for about a half hour or so. I would recommend checking this place out whether your skiing or not!! You will have fun either way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-16,3,"Our 5 year old daughter got a great lesson from Ronald. We had a good time, even though the snow was pretty thin. We will be back when there is more snow. Pack a lunch, the food is expensive for what you get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-16,3,"We made a ""last minute"" decision to enjoy Red Lodge Mountain while my daughter was home on Holiday break from College-While the snow wasn't great the combined low price of lift tickets on line and low gas prices made it a great day! No lines at the lifts, food, rentals,etc-great parking and the staff was professional and courteous-It's a shame more people don't take advantage of the combined value and fun-We had a really nice Father-Daughter day that was low key, low stress,affordable, and enjoyable-I would-(and probably will) do a mid week visit to my favorite ski area again-Montana Values from a great Montana Ski destination-Thanks for the great day!-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-15,5,"We had a great time. It is so local and personalized. The staff were all sweet, friendly and helpful. Low prices and polite low-key skiiers. Hate to give glowing reviews because it might draw in the wrong element, but it is true! Loved it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-16,4,"This will be our new favorite ski mountain. $38 on-line lift tickets, incredible terrain. They just need more snow as half the runs were closed.

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-15,4,Had a great time at Red Lodge Mountain! The best parts about the trip were the good skiing conditions and the lessons that my 5 year old son and 7 year old niece took. By the end of the first day my 5 year old son was off the beginner hill and successfully went down a green run riding a lift to the top! He was elated and so was the whole family! The staff at Red Lodge are top notch and care about your visit to their mountain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-15,4,"We went to Red Lodge Mountain for a skiing vacation during last Christmas week. It is a nice place, quiet and neat. The mountain is not very crowed. Only half is open but the tickets were still in full price. Services are excellent, people are friendly and helpful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-16,4,not bad at all but yeah this mountian was pretty good for not having all the snow that they normally have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-16,5,"I learned how to ski years ago by taking a lesson at Red Lodge Mountain. My boys both learned how to snowboard by taking lessons there as well. The group lessons are wonderful. It has always been a treat to go skiing there. We try to make the trip for a couple weekends a year, and have been doing so for almost 20 years. The staff are very friendly and helpful! It's so worth the 7 hour trip to ski this mountain!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-16,4,The ski instructors are very nice and professional. My family had a great time! We went on a Saturday and didn't ever have to stand in lines longer than 5 people ahead of us. They happily slowed the chair lifts for my youngest inexperienced daughter to get on without difficulty. Everyone was very friendly. The snow was good. A few slopes were closed for not enough snow. But the majority were open. It was a great day!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-16,3,"My first visit to Red Lodge Mountain was on a Saturday, so it was crowded with families but since there is enough room to spread out, this didn't present a problem. There were no long lines for lifts. There were lots of people in the lodge, but enough room to accommodate them comfortably. There were lots of options on the trails for skiers of all levels. The only drawback was the snow quality was not great. On the website, the base depth was listed as 18"" to 20"". I don't think I came across an area that had more than 10"" and there were large patches of dirt exposed in some of the busier areas. With a deeper base and some powder, this would be a great place to ski!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-16,4,"Wonderful experience!! Everyone was accommodating. There was never long lines, it is obvious that this business knows how to provide great customer service and experience!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-16,2,"No snow, which was not fault of resort, but was treated terribly. MOST important, the only two decent runs were horrid by ski racing, one both days, one run wasn't properly signed and led us (with two 3 year olds) to black diamond runs - with NO WARNING; on the second day, we 'broke; the tape on the practice run to get our young ones down safely and were stopped and berated by the ""practice"" team. I am a former professional snowboarder, and it has been a long time since I have been so disappointed in a resort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-15,3,"My most recent visit to Red Lodge, I was welcomed by 16"" of new powder! Needless to say, my day on the mountain was great. I grew up skiing Red Lodge and always love going there, even if the snow isn't good, it's a good excuse to sit in the Bierstube!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-15,2,"Came here with family to snowboard. Before we got on first lift, lift attendent walked passed us and said ""ugh, snowboarders"". We had a good half day, then at two pm the lift attendents started checking for leashes so wouldn't let us up the lifts unless we went to shops to buy a leash. Evidently this is a state law, but we live in Montana and have never ever had this happen and we are frequent snowboarders all over the state. The new snowboards do not need this device because we strap or foot in when we go on the lift. So no other mountain enforces this outdated law because of this reason. Would not recommend this resort if you are a snowboarder. Unless you want to spend $7 at the store for a leash (and put a ring on your boot too because they don't even make a place to put a leash on new boots)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-15,4,We are teaching my 3-year-old to ski and Red Lodge Mountain is a perfect resort for kids. Family friendly base lodge with helpful staff and just enough terrain for everyone to have a good time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-14,3,"Small town ski area feel. Good runs, nice variety of terrain. Mostly an intermediate's mountain but there is some expert terrain if you seek it out. Lift system seems a bit disjointed but functional. Red Lodge town is fun at night for plenty of apris ski activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul-15,3,We loved the mountain and all of the scenery after taking the Beartooth Highway(route 212) from tower junction in Yellowstone to Red Lodge.

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul-14,3,it's really awesome small town in the valley of mountains. best to visit in summer and ski seasons. It is in the way to Yellowstone national park. It is place to take holiday from concrete jungle cities and nurture nature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-15,4,Most of the lifts are old school and the road up the mountain is dirt - but this mountain is a blast to ski with lots of varied terrain and the snow was great even though it had been very warm for the two weeks prior to our visit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,4,We were on a ski trip to Montana this past March. Red Lodge Mountain was the first ski area we visited. The staff at the ticket window were helpful. And our skiing experience was very nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,3,"If you are looking for a TRUE Montana ski experience try Red Lodge Mountain. Over the past several years I have seen skiers wearing cowboy hats and jeans, a moose crossing the road heading up the mountain and deer running across a ski run. Many days you feel like you have the place to you and 10 friends. Even when there's lots of people the lift lines move along quickly. This is a great place to have a family Montana ski vacation that gives you a ski town feel without needing to take out a loan to pay for it. If pretentious skiers is what you're looking for this is NOT your place. But if you seek a great family friendly mountain with fun runs and amazing views and is often referred to be considered a hidden gem, you found your place. A lift ride conversation here, may very well end in a long-lasting friendship!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,3,"Despite a cloudy day, we had a blast skiing here. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful as we were not familiar with the slopes. The slopes were in good condition and runs were great. The only hinderance, very little visibility because of snow and a cloud was out of their control. I hope I can come back and ski there again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,5,Red Lodge is a great ski lodge for the entire family! The staff are exceptionally friendly even at the end of their season! The chalet is nice with amazing chocolate chip cookies and the bar is a great place to rest at the end of the day to wait for the kids to come off of the mountain! The absolute best was that we had an opportunity to ski above the clouds...amazing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,3,We had a great 3 days of skiing. The weather was nice and warm. Roughly 50 each day. The first day was a little icy but after that it was great.

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,5,"We have taken our family to Red Lodge skiing on several occasions. We are from out of state, and it is a long drive, but always worth it.

I was frantic and upset because this ring meant a lot to me as my Nana gave it to me almost 10 years ago on her death bed.\nThe staff at Red Lodge went above and beyond to help me find it! They went as far as to grab an electric screwdriver and began taking apart the deck In hopes to find it!! Although we did not find i that day, I will never forget the trouble they went through to help me find it!\n3 days later, I just received a call saying it was found!! I am so thankful for all they have done for me.\nThank you Red Lodge!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,5,"5 Stars for Red Lodge Ski Patrol! We went skiing on President's Day. The conditions were icy. My husband had only been skiing at a ""Hill"" in ND. We should've gotten him some lessons, but we didn't and he super-manned it down the mountain quite a few times on his belly. The ski-patrol was there to help, some of whom weren't even on duty that day! We tapped-out at noon, covered in snow-rash. We will be back for lessons and powder! Thank you Red Lodge ski-patrol!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,4,"There was a lot of ice areas. But, I am sure it was due to all the warm weather that had occurred the week before and then it froze.

The employees' were very friendly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-17,4,I would love it if Red Lodge had a childcare system for the kids that can't ski. I end up sitting in the lodge the whole day with the baby and toddler while the two older kids and husband get to ski.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-17,3,"We visited Red Lodge over the New Year holiday and had an amazing time! All the staff employed at Red Lodge Mountain were wonderful, from the parking attendants, gift shop, snack bar, to the lift attendants.

Thanks for a great ski vacation, can't wait to go back!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-17,3,"The terrain and skiing are good. The bathrooms in the base lodge are gross -- on par with a seedy truck stop. The base lodge is rather small and is crowded on busy days. Lifts are slow and on the latest trip one lift was running at half speed due to a mechanical issue that purportedly won't be fixed until next year. Food and beverage prices are very high, quality is average at best. The town of Red Lodge is very nice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-16,3,We had a great time at Red Lodge skiing. It was windy one day but was awesome the others. My kids are new to skiing and they loved the good options for green runs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-19,2,Mountain wasn‚Äôt groomed. Like at all. Gift shop only had huge sizes in both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs clothes. The Stube (restaurant/bar) needs to be bigger it was soooo crowded you couldn‚Äôt walk. Draft beers were good but the famous beer cheese dip was nothing special.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-18,3,Great skiing in a true Western town. Great prices for amazing skiing. Easy drive from Red Lodge up the mountain. No shuttle though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-18,3,This is a cute mountain. Am I supposed to say cute? Haha First time I have been there. Certainly different than the big resorts in Wyoming and Utah but I liked the atmosphere. Seemed very family friendly. \nThe conditions were way different than I expected but again early season and not really knowing the mountain well we were in some runs that weren‚Äôt my cup of tea. Overall it was a good experience and if we go back it will be later in the season. \nThe magic carpet and beginning area was great!! My husband took our 3 year old down on her snowboard and the price is perfect~ free!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-18,4,"I‚Äôve grown up in the Red Lodge area and have been skiing RLM since I was 3 years old. I don‚Äôt have enough good things to say, it‚Äôs a small community oriented mountain with big terrain. \nThere are rarely any lift lines and plenty of hidden terrain. Red Lodge has a easygoing, resort town vibe and lots of restaurants for after the mountain closes. Beginners have easy access to easy terrain and good instructors at their disposal. Intermediate will be delighted at the signature ‚ÄúLazy M.‚Äù Advanced skiers will find excellent tree skiing and steeps off of Cole Creek.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr-18,4,I would highly recommend taking a lesson prior to skiing if you have never skied. Our instructors were patient and kind. I would also suggest buying a ski helmet. Our family rented skis etc and thought we could purchase helmets at the store if needed. Helmets were scarce so we went without - would not recommend. As a family we flew into Billings so we didn‚Äôt want to pack too much. Beautiful mountain and helpful staff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr-18,4,We are a family of snowboarders. We love this mountain. It has such great variety for all of us. We‚Äôll be back again. The only ding is the parking lot is nasty to drive or walk through.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr-18,4,So beautiful &amp; great skiing conditions we had a blast skiing here yesterday very beautiful &amp; lots of runs from beginners to expects.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-18,2,"We visited during March of 2018 for my son to compete in a free-ride competition and unfortunately the snow conditions were poor. There was plenty of snow but we hit it after a week of warm weather and then cold temps the days were we there left the snow rock hard to icy. The lower mountain groomers were ok in the afternoon after the sun had softened them a bit. The chairs that service the area from the bottom near the lodge are S-L-O-W. Right at the base there is a triple chair, a carpet tow for the beginner area, a double that accesses easy terrain, and another double that starts a little higher up but accesses the same terrain as the triple. But once you get back in the Cole Creek and Palisades areas, those have high speed quads to move you along. The terrain would be fabulous with some fresh snow. The view from the top of the Grizzly chair is amazing, and skiing down in the Palisades area is very picturesque. So it's got a lot going for it and would be a great area with better snow. There's also a midway chalet on the upper part of the mountain that offers a nice bar and grill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-18,3,Great little spring break trip! Would recommend to anyone who is learning or already a master! The lift operators are very nice and helpful if you need directions! The lodge is a very welcoming area with a cozy wood fireplace smell!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-18,3,"Altitude without the attitude! This is a great, no frills, skiing mountain; no lines, no crowds on the hill, VERY picturesque and inexpensive tickets! Limited options for group lessons in comparisons to other larger resorts. But, the instructor, Jake, we got for our 9 year old in a group and then in a private was excellent. \n\nFood and beverages at the Bierstube were surprisingly reasonable! \n\nAll in all, this ski resort is an excellent value!! Our family would recommend this ski resort!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-17,4,Mountain operations does a great job daily in getting mountain ready for skiers even when they are short on snow. Fun times for sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-17,4,"Bluebird day. Snow in really good condition. Good in the bierstube good, really super waitress. Love the mountain!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-17,4,"Even though there wasn't great coverage on the upper mountain, we enjoyed the blue cruisers and mogul filled runs. The base area seemed to get a bit congested and lacked an organized system. We weren't sure if there was a line or where we should wait to get on the lift. Line separators may help with some of the confusion. We will be back as we were able to score some discounted tickets by buying in advance online.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-17,3,Good mountain for family. A little slick but good. Why isn't there a tubing hill? Really disappointed it doesn't have one as it would be great for families. Need a bigger chalet for hanging out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-17,3,Had a great time with the family skiing and snowboarding. Decently priced and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Will go again for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-16,3,"It was windy this particular day, so a bit of the mountain was closed. As always, though, Red Lodge is a great resort. I'm from Billings so it's close, prices are reasonable, and the people are always nice. Great time, despite the weather.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-17,4,"This place is not a bad ski resort, but a 1 1/2 hour extra drive to Big Sky or Bridger Bowl is worth it in my opinion. I have been going to Red Lodge for at least 15 years and I have to say in those 15 years they haven't upgraded much, they added a yurt at the bottom which in my opinion was a cheap cop out to building another dining area. But that's about it. The triple chair (their main lift) is old and is always stopping, and all other lifts are old double chairs except for the back side and ""bonus area"". Those lifts are high speed quads, which is great except for the fact that those areas aren't even open half the time. Why would a ski area put all the money into something that's not open that much, doesn't make sense. I still like the ski area but every year that goes by without them upgrading anything is another year I will choose to take my family and friends elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-17,3,"Had a good day with the kids, the magic carpet was a little busy at times but not bad. The lines for the lifts were not bad, got right on the chair almost ever time. Just need more snow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-17,4,Excellent groomed trails. No lines. Bright sunshine. Spring like conditions. Snow comes by tomorrow with a mild cold front. Pleasant employees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-17,4,"Ski here often, lovely local mountain with small town feel and great runs. It's the type of place that has options for all skill levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,4,We are typically people who do not go back to the same vacation place. We love to explore new places. We had such a wonderful time in Red Lodge last year we came back again this year. This ski resort is absolutely wonderful! The people both at the ski resort and in town are so friendly and kind! You feel like you are family. The runs are great and they offer a great time for those that are just learning and for those that can handle the blacks. Pack a lunch or eat in the chalet. Either way be sure to get a chocolate chip cookie...amazing! They also have a wonderful bar for the parents to rest if they get done skiing before the kids!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,5,Unfortunately there was so much ice it was to ski on any of the runs except Miami. We didn't stay all day and paid for the entire day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,3,"After traveling 900 miles from Minneapolis, I did not expect I would need a tank to navigate their terrible parking lot. Their are holes that you could lose your vehicle in..........terrible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,3,"Red Lodge is a quaint, family friendly ski resort. There is something for all levels of skiers. The staff are super helpful and pleasant. We have been going to Red Lodge for 5 years and have not been disappointed with our experience. The only variable is the conditions, but they have been good 80% of the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,4,"We were in Billings for something totally different and decided to take our girls skiing at Red Lodge for their first skiing experience. It couldn't have been better. \n\nFirst off, the mountain is a mountain. It's 10K high, so it was everything we had also experienced in Colorado. The instructors were top notch. Very encouraging and friendly with new skiers. Our girls had never skied and were on a lift after 1 hour of great instruction. They fell a few times over the course of the rest of the day, but nothing major and all fun.\n\nThe cost was so reasonable. Way less than what we expected to have to pay. We were debating whether we'd return to Billings for the same event next spring. If we do, we might try and carve out more than one day of skiing since it was such a good experience!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,5,"Staff is great, Nice layout of terrain and good grooming. Adequate snow-making on front side of mountain, but would be much better if they had at least a few trails for each of the Quads that are installed but dependent upon adequate snow coverage. The last few years have really highlighted the necessity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,5,Just started skiing four weeks ago and I'm hooked! Every staff member I've interacted with has been awesome! Really looking forward to next year so I can try out some bigger runs!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,4,"Our trip was planned to snowboard March 9, 10, &amp; 11 but when we arrived on the 10th, the power on the mountain was out so no lifts were running. We decided not to wait and find something else in Red Lodge to do. We contacted Liftopia and they offered 20% if you used your ticket or a different date to use a ticket. Unfortunately, we were only scheduled to be there the three days and had purchased the three days. We left out $80 which was frustrating but we had a good time while we were there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,3,Red Lodge should have compensated for the power outage. Lifts turned on at 11:45. We were among the first to arrive before 9 am.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,3,We had a great day on the mountain with our church youth group. Everyone had fun and the snow was quite good. The Staff were excellent!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-18,5,"Had a great ski day at Red Lodge in February. Mind, the weather was in the 20's with minimum wind--a vast improvement over the negative temps the week before. The parking lot was packed but there is a shuttle. Prices were great. ($49.00 for a half day). Moutain was well groomed. Mannerly people at the sales window and on the slopes. I almost hate saying nice things because although the lot was packed, there were no lines for the lifts. We only did blue and green slopes but they were mostly great. I did get on one that was a passageway between runs. A bit narrow with a small section that was really steep. Still, had one of the most beautiful ski experiences of my life there. Can't wait to go back!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-18,5,"The primary lift you have to take up in the morning is an old slow triple prone to breakage. It broke the day before we arrived and we heard people were stuck on the thing in subzero temps for 90 minutes. The lift is wind exposed and is the primary notable weak link of an otherwise great mid-size resort. It's such a sore that even the locals will tell you to ride that lift once a day and then get off of it. It's a shame as there is some nice terrain accessible from the lift that we chose to ignore except for our run down at the end of the day.\n\nOn the other hand, the Grizzly Peak old slow double is perfectly suited for where it is located. It is not a critical lift that you have to ride, and the time it takes to go up is fair for the length of the runs. No problem here. Downside is some of the nicest runs require you to finish up all the way at the base area and then you'd have to take up the POS triple again. No thanks.\n\nThey have a high speed detachable quad called Palisades which runs as a very slow speed quad. It makes no sense. We asked the lift attendant if something was wrong and he said it was actually a high speed lift ""but this is as fast as management chooses to run it."" So that was also a kick in the jewels and kept us off otherwise nice blue terrain. It was too cold to sit on that slow lift.\n\nThe shining star of the resort is the Coal Creek high speed quad. That runs at normal speed, serves epic terrain, and you can do laps on the thing all day and be entertained. Had a lot of fun off that lift,\n\nAlso enjoyed both the mid-lodge and the Stube at the bottom of the hill. Friendly ski bar with fine food, friendly bartenders and fair prices. We enjoyed the soup of the day, chili, pretzels, beers and bloodys. \n\nLook forward to coming back to the resort, but it's a shame about the Triple chair which I also don't recall having a safety bar. Being old and accident prone, it'd certainly be nice if it as least had a bar for a family friendly resort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-18,4,"After 18 years, it was time to get back into skiing and have my 12 year old take lessons. Glad we went! Miami Beach was a wonderful beginner run (a little steep on part) but not crowded. Would definitely do the 2 hour private lesson again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-18,4,"I took 2 private lessons. The first was great, the second time around my 1.5 hour lesson started 10 min late and ended 5 min early. Disappointing on such a short lesson",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-18,3,"I have skied 50 years. Started in Michigan in the 60's. Since then I have skied alll of Colorado ,parts of Utah and Tahoe. Stood in line a lot. Red Lodge is the quintessential ski resort. Low key , needs more quads lifts but harkens back to a time when you could take your family skiing and not go broke. Nice long runs , fast cruisers, moguls if you want. No Lines ! Walk to the parking lot bring your grille and cook out for lunch. Not a big resort at almost 17000 acres but big enough and similar to many smaller Colorado resorts. I love Vail and the back bowls but if you are near Billings and want a really nice day of skiing at a fair price go to Red Lodge. The town is perfect Western also ,low key and casual.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-17,4,"Great prices, great skiing, very short lift lines. We enjoyed 2 days of skiing here. Our kids took lessons and got their first taste of skiing. The instructors were friendly. Not sure I'd rent our ski equipment at the mountain though. The ""cashier"" made us fill out paperwork twice (unnecessarily, we came to find out), tried to charge us twice, and didn't seem to know (or maybe care about) what he was doing. I'd recommend renting equipment in town for cheaper prices and more knowledgeable staff. Other than that, we enjoyed our time at RLM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-17,4,"Short lift lines, great snow conditions, and killer trails makes RLM our favorite! The trails offer lots of variety for family members with differing abilities yet the mountain is small enough that it's easy to meet up again--say for hot cocoa at the mid-mountain lodge. \n\nSerious skiers won't be disappointed with incredible glades and amazing expert-only areas away from the beginners. For the more cautious skier in your family, try the wide open Miami Beach or Turnpike. All of the runs offer stunning views/vistas of the Montana plains looking north toward Billings. Bring your camera! \n\nFood offerings are solid from the burritos and draft beer at the mid-mountain lodge to the appetizers and cocktails at the Bierstube. We recommend taking a pass on the cafeteria in the main lodge on the weekends--it's small and crowded and tricky to walk around in your ski boots--too many stairs.\n\nAs a three-generation family visiting for three days during the busy Christmas/New Year holiday week, we loved every minute and the mountain never felt crowded. The town of Red Lodge offers great hotels (the Pollard) and restaurants (Carbon County Steak House). Do your family a favor and skip the madness of the mega-ski resort and ski where there is something for the whole family and small enough that you can all see each other during the day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-17,4,My 12 year old tried snow boarding for the first time. He said the lesson was very informative. He was able to do it on his own and be confident by the end of the day. The rental and lift ticket and lesson purchase was a little frustrating but got through it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-17,4,"RL continues to offer a nice variety of runs, friendly &amp; helpful staff and great cheese fries! Affordable skiing without the lines and hassle. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area. We drive from MN annually to ski here - it‚Äôs our favorite!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-17,5,"Timed our visit perfectly for visiting on opening weekend. 3"" of fresh powder fell in cold temps the night before we went up the mountain. We drove a front wheel drive economy rental up without too much trouble although extreme caution was necessary driving on snow packed road without guard rails. Short lift ticket line and small sky shop were welcoming. Nice selection of runs open and lift lines were non-existent. Overall a nice place to ski.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,5,"Drainage and coal chute were epic! Plenty of snow, fun staff, and fantastic trail conditions. Can't wait to go back!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,4,"The 1st day was amazing, however given the age of the mountain/resort I'd hope for high speed lifts for their primary lifts up the mountain, not on the smaller runs on the back side of the mountain as it is here. It's very frustrating when the lift takes longer to get up than it does to ski down the mountain. \n\nThe prices are reasonable as well as the rentals for my children. The design of the lodge and access to the lifts is a bit difficult being you have to walk UP a steep hill in ski boots to get to the kids bunny slop and any of the ski lifts. This is a huge challenge for the new skiers who aren't use to walking in ski boots. It took my son 10 minutes just to get up hill to the lift! Ultimately this is just a poor design which won't change being it's built :( If your new to the mountain this would be a nice heads up! \n\nMost of the staff was very nice as well. I'd love to see them put in at least two new high speed lifts though!!! I have skied all over the U.S and in other countries as well, so I do have a good compassion to the other types of mountains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,4,"My family has season passes to Red Lodge Mountain and have for a few years now. The hill is great for all types of skills. My snowboarder son loves the terrain park. The staff is awesome and so welcoming! Just a great, friendly place!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,5,"We chose Red Lodge over Big Sky and for a number of reasons, I'm so glad we did. Prices were affordable and the trails were great for a beginner like me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,5,"Awesome that all the lifts were open. it was the best skiing at Red Lodge in a long time. Snow is great, lots of runs open.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,4,RLM is so fun and the staff is very friendly. Can't wait to go again. Love to stop for beers at the mid lodge and at the Bierstube.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,4,The community is very friendly and the sites are amazing. Our rented house worked out better than expected for us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,3,"14 inches of new snow! short lift lines, very helpful staff. good lessons for the young ones, and great hard runs for the more experienced skiers in our group. very good overall 2 days on the mountain!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,4,Wonderful friendly mountain that is accessible and affordable. There is terrain for every level of skier and lift tickets only cost me $40 a day when ordered from the red lodge Web site! We will be back thank you red lodge!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr-16,2,"So this part of the country has super unpredictable snow. Was a terrible season for Red Lodge, but they got this late season storm (after they closed for the season) that brought 55"" of really wet snow, so they reopened the first week of April with super cheap lift ticket prices, so we went. Had an absolute blast. My girlfriend grew up on the east coast and hates powder skiing (I know, I know, it's a point of contention in our relationship... haha) so even though there was a lot of snow, the heaviness made it more like groomed skiing. I though there was a good variety of runs (granted only half the mountain was open) and it felt like pretty good access. The snow was super sticky, but we had a blast. I can see where the skiing can be rough with little snow though. The mid mountain lodge was great with good beer specials and the perfect location really. The rental shop was very efficient and the pricing was reasonable. I really hope they can have more low price ticket days to attract people from the region. My only 2 complaints were that the retail shop was very disappointing, granted end of the season, but they didn't even appear to sell skies or anything besides some socks and sweatshirts. And The road up to the mountain is a little rough with some bad potholes. There were survey stakes all the way up though, so I would assume this is getting remedied this summer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-16,4,"Skied with multiple family members for three days at the end of March, mid-week plus Saturday. The property was well maintained and served our family of first-time to out-of-practice-mellow skiers/boarders well; not sure what it's like for more experienced/aggressive skiers. My 12 yr old son took a beginner snowboarder lesson with Ryan, he was excellent: patient and friendly, and he had my son off of the ""magic carpet"" and riding the beginner slopes before the end of the lesson. Best of all there were NO crowds, even on Saturday the longest lift line we experienced was only 4 people deep, and the staff/crew were all super friendly. The surrounding town of Red Lodge was only minutes away and offered plenty of places to eat/drink/shop. Would love to come back next winter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-16,5,"We had two families, four adults and four kids (14, 13, and two 12 year olds). The skiing was absolutely wonderful! Great runs from beginner to way advanced! No lines for two days...Saturday before Easter there were some lines but they went super fast and the most you waited was a couple minutes. People of RL were super friendly! Recommend bringing your own lunches but be sure to pick up the super big cookies at the lodge ... The kids loved them!!! (I am sure the RL food was good...but save some more $$ on bringing your own and much healthier.). Bring a roll of quarters for the lockers. We rented from the ski station in town. We also bought lift tickets on the RL web page...we ordered them each day around 4:30-5pm. Great deals. Couldn't believe how ridiculously cheat the skiing was. Fantastic family vacation!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-16,4,"We live in Billings, Montana which is about an hour drive from Red Lodge Mountain. We enjoy skiing here because it is close and affordable. The total snow fall by year is unpredictable so we don't buy season passes but we have bought 6-tix to save on the daily lift ticket costs. Unfortunately this year we did not time the use of our 6-tix and we only were able to use 3 of the 6 tickets. The resort decided to close 2 weeks early because of the lack of snow fall and like many years, the best snow fell in the last week that they were open with this early close date. \n\nPutting that aside, which is nature's fault not the fault of the administration, we LOVE skiing Red Lodge. There are 3 places to eat; the Main Lodge which allows you to bring your own food; the Bierstube which is more of an adult atmosphere with a patio for warmer days; and Midway which also has a patio for warmer days and is open Friday - Sundays. The food is nothing fancy and the prices are resort prices but the atmosphere is always fun and the staff are ALWAYS very cheerful and happy to be there. \n\nThis is definitely a resort that welcomes children. There is a ""Magic Carpet"" for beginners and beginner lessons. Miami Beach is also an excellent place for your young ones to get experience skiing. This year the back side was not open when we were there because there was not enough snow but the Triple Chair lift from the bottom easily accesses the Midway Lodge from where you can catch a nearby Grizzly Peak chair that takes you to both black diamond and blue runs or you can ski down green runs from Midway using Turnpike (easy wide slope), Bobcat and a few others. The Triple Chair lift is a 7 minute ride and the ski down is 3-5 minutes depending on your experience level. \n\nIt seems there are often racing events on the weekends which adds to the frivolity of the mountain. There is also a course for snowboarders and skiers to practice their jumps. \n\nAll around good times in a friendly Montana local. I just wish they had more predictable snow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-16,4,"We love RLM! We have enjoyed a family ski trip annually since 2003! It is affordable, there is enough terrain for every level of skier and the community of Red Lodge is charming-great amenities! Check to see if ""The Palisades"" is open-RLM gets late spring snow. You usually can't go wrong with this destination for family fun!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-16,4,We had a really great time. Even with little snow this winter the rubs were nice and groomed. Some of the lifts weren't open but the youth group still had a blast. They really liked the jumps in the terrain park. They also liked watching the racers. The lodge is nice and friendly workers. We will be planning to come again next year. Thanks for a fun youth trip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-15,4,WE went snowboarding with the family and had a blast. They are all willing to help and very friendly. We have been here twice and love it every time we visit Montana,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-16,5,"Good, despite really poor snow this year. I'd go again, I love the free under 5 and free magic carpet for teaching our kids. I didn't really get to do many harder runs for that reason, but I look forward to it. Poor snow this year, and I wish the lift tickets would reflect that difficulty with access. The Lodge is kind of ridiculously overpriced and uncomfortable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-16,3,"Loved Red Lodge Mountain &amp; all employees were so friendly! Our grandchildren ages 7,8, &amp; 4 years old all took ski lessons, there first time ever skiing! Instructors were great &amp; kids skiied like they have been skiing forever, adults had lessons too &amp; learned so much, forever grateful for all the wonderful memories!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-16,2,The Good:\nEvery employee was friendly and helpful. They seemed genuinely glad we were there. We rented equipment and it was in good condition. The mountain has a little something for every level of skier. We come to ski Red lodge from California to get away from the crowds and the cost is reasonable for our family of five. \nThe Bad:\nRed Lodge was having unseasonably warm weather and not much snow. The groomed runs were fine for us beginners though. \nThe Ugly:\nMy son hit a tree and broke his leg! The ski patrol did an absolutely amazing job putting him in a traction splint and getting him off the mountain. I can't thank them enough for their professionalism and expertise. When we were completely helpless they took over and got us to safety. \n\nWe will ski Red Lodge again. I highly recommend wearing a helmet and staying away from the trees!\n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,5,The snow was great but we sat in the lodge until 11:30 waiting for the power to come on. We got 20% of our money refunded but sat nearly half the day. I think a half day pass would been better. We haven't been up for 2 years and were considering a season pass next year. Not sure now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,5,"We took the young boys on two separate days, they are 9 and 7 years old. We bought the tickets online which was a nice savings. We went during the middle of the week, it was not crowded at all, we never waited in a line. The second day the quad chair was open and we really liked those runs. The chair lift is wonderful, it slows down to get on and is fast and then the run is longer. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We went on the triple chair and it loads quite fast, but they slowed it down for us, which was nice. The runs were well groomed, they had gotten some new snow. The only reason it is a 4 star, is that I wish there were a few more healthy food choices in the main lodge and maybe not quite so expensive. The nice thing is that you can bring your own lunch if you want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,5,Had a great day on the mountain. Staff was friendly and efficient. It only took minutes to get my son's rental skis fitted and out the door.

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,4,"I've been coming out to Red Lodge Mountain for years now and I must say, this place is awesome! The skiing is great and the people are fantastic. It is not Montana's biggest or most luxurious skiing, in fact I stop very short of calling it ""resort"" but it is real skiing for real skiers who want a great place to ski, eat, drink, and relax with thier families!

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul-17,3,We drove up to the mountain. It was a gorgeous day and the views were wonderful. I imagine it is a great place to ski in the winter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul-17,3,As a novice skier I enjoy the ease of riding down Miami Beach. The staff has been friendly and helpful every time we have been there. \nThe snowboarding lessons for our son were extremely helpful and affordable. They showed kindness and patience with him which made the rest of the trip even more enjoyable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jun-17,3,"Found it.......perfection. \nAmericans need to see this place as classic USA small town beauty and charm. 2200 residents but the town has it all.....mountain beauty, skiing, outdoor everything, at least one parade a month, gateway to Yellowstone via "" America's most beautiful drive""....according to Charles Kuralt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,May-17,3,"We stayed at the Red Lodge Inn in Red Lodge Montana. Daniel &amp;Tiffany are the owners, and they are very accomodating, and the rooms are very clean. We will stay there again in the near future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,May-17,3,"From Billings, MT to Red Lodge town (56 miles) you will see the gateway to Yellowstone Park with wonderful and unbelievable views, by Beartooth highway! Trees, snow, ice, bears! The place is unforgettable!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr-17,4,Stopped by and enjoyed the bar and the view. The weather was not very good as it was snowing and blowing but still a good look.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr-17,5,"This resort has something for everyone. The groomers made for ""hero"" skiing, the off piste challenging and fun, and the knee deep powder a welcomed treat in April! We appreciated the vibe, beer and food in the beer stube where we finished our day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar-17,4,Great time and our lodging at the Cornerview was awesome! We had excellent rates at the ski resort which allowed us to take our younger grandchildren skiing The ski slopes were well groomed and our group had super days skiing. The people are all very friendly and the eating places were very welcoming. Great vacation!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr-17,5,We boarded Sunday and Monday. Fresh powder both days and no busy lines. Everyone was friendly. Loved it as always!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr-17,2,"We had a fantastic day April 1st on our way home. We were going to ski Big Sky again but the snow looked good at Red Lodge and wanted to try it. The conditions were exactly as reported and it was the best day we had all week! It is so much north facing that the steep trees were deep powder still even on a warm day. The open slopes were fine, too. It was late afternoon before it got sticky. There were no rocks anywhere. Staff was great, online tickets saved us a bunch of money compared to the big places, food good at the midway lodge. Only complaint, and this is lame, is that we had to walk up several flights of stairs after we parked because we got there late on a powder day Saturday and the lot was full. The triple is a little long and slow but Cole Creek was a great lift and all are comfortable. Plenty of mix of terrain for all of us to ski together most of the time, intermediate to advanced. Definitely worth trying for a couple days this season yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,2,icy Way to expensive. For what you get. If I had to do it again I would have went to Bridger bowl.for about the same money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,4,My first time there. I just moved to the area but I was impressed with the mountain . I came here from Colorado so I am hard to please.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,3,"Has better runs than found on the east and Midwest, especially for he price. There are NO lift lines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,3,"We like to hit the slopes here for a day, get-away. The drive is fairly short from Billings and the scenery is nice year round. The skiing conditions are really good this year, other than the warmer days of late causing some crust on the dust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,4,I have been skiing this mountain since I was a kid. It never gets old and it's always a great time. The food is good and the staff is awesome. Plus you gotta love no lift lines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,4,"We love Red Lodge. We've had beginners for awhile with three kids and the magic carpet is always the first stop. I love the option for a Malibu lift ticket only for the upgrade. The kids have a ball. This weekend's snow was perfect - you can't get better than Montana/Wyoming powder. Its got great options, great variety, great value. I'm a fan!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,4,"We found this place by accident, and it was a great find! \n\nThere is terrain for all levels of skiing. The lifts are a bit slow but that didn't take away from the day's fun!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb-17,3,"Great day. Haven't been to the mountain for over 20 years, just moved back to Billings. In our 50's, but think it's time to get back into it. People at the rental shack were great, mountain looks in good shape. We'll be back!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec-16,5,"Always love skiing RL! large enough for experienced skiers, but small enough that I can take the kids to have fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan-17,4,"We had a fantastic time. Loved the variety and friendly people! Although the snow was thin this early in the season, we managed to see most of the ski hill. We certainly hope to be back soon. Loved the town and got great deals on lift tickets. This ski resort has lots to offer for everyone at any skiing ability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-21,4,"I almost don't want to write this review, because I feel like I'm giving away a secret. This mountain has a lot of pitch and wonderful steep terrain (with trees) on the back side. It was an easy experience to ski here, the food services were great, and we appreciated that people were wearing masks. Heads up: make sure to reserve lift tickets on weekends and a place in the dining area--everything is limited this year because of covid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jul-19,4,"Skiing, hiking and mountain biking. You pretty much have the mountain to your self mid week. Remote and beautiful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-19,3,"Truthfully I was not skiing on this last visit because of an injury but my friends and my family had a wonderful time and I was super jealous as I have enjoyed skiing here in years past. The front side of the mountain is great green and blues, which our kids loved having some independence to ski on their own. The backside is for the more experienced skier and has some wicked black and double black runs that overlook the valley containing the adorable little town of Phillipsburg. But even sitting on the sidelines, I had a great day soaking up the sun, knitting and reading. I even joined an online meeting from the lodge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-19,1,Don't do kinderski unless you want your child to stand around for two hours. No one bothered to call the next day to discuss this concern as they said they would. Discussed with the owner and he made me feel bad for calling. Terrible experience. Do not recommend unless you want instructors to make your kid cry then ignore them. Incredible waste of money with the worst customer service and complete disregard for the well being of children I've ever experienced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Dec-18,5,"We really enjoyed skiing here over the holiday. The snow was good, we never waited for a lift, reasonable prices on tickets and food. We had great weather and a very nice day on the slopes. Highly recommend for families.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-18,3,"Fresh snow and uncrowded slopes and an extreme discount! We were turned on to Discovery Ski mountain by cousins who live in Missoula MT after another trip we had planned fell through over lack of snow. Discovery is just a ski area though and not a true resort. We stayed outside of Missoula and drove about 45 miles to the ski area. It wasn‚Äôt too far but I did have to drive in the snow. Next trip I‚Äôm considering renting a house at Georgetown lake near the foot of the mountain to be a little closer. The mountain has tons of trails for every level of skier or snowboarder. We didn‚Äôt have to wait in lift lines at all. Seriously never had more than three people ahead of us. There is a restaurant where you can warm up and get eats and drinks. It was very inexpensive compared to what we were used to. The workers in the rental shop, at the restaurant, and the patrol on the slopes were all very nice and accommodating. One of the children snowboarding in our group did a hard face plant. The snow patrol took him to a recovery / 1st aid area where he was checked for concussion and cleared before being allowed to continue. The rentals were inexpensive as were the lift tickets. Amazingly I returned home from this vacation with money leftover in our vacation fund! I should also add that while it wasn‚Äôt easy to find flights into Missoula MT that the airport was easy and we injoyed our time in the city of Missoula as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-18,3,Really great rental shop staff-Chris provided awesome customer service! Thank you! \nThe mountain is amazing and we had a ton of fun. Really hated the lifts on the backside of the mountain though - definitely in need of some upgrades :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-18,3,Discovery is a fabulous place where family and friends meets to have a great time! Their kids ski classes is absolutely awesome! Their instructors are great and have lots of love for the kids! Always great to have a cookie and hot coco when the kids are done!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan-18,4,"We actually only skied 1/2 a day on our way to Missoula but it was still fab skiing.\nLift pass was excellent value, all the staff we met, lift operators, ski patrol &amp; lady who greeted us at the base station, were extremely friendly.\nGreat ski area with a great variety of runs all in great conditions even at the end of the day.\nWish this ski area was our local mountain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan-17,3,I have been to Discovery multiple times with my kids. The mountain has runs for all skill levels and has a terrain park for snowboarders to enjoy. I have never experienced lift lines here and the last time I went the temp was -20 deg so there was only a hand full of people on the whole mountain... (no locals just crazy travelers on vacation like me) The staff at the day lodge and the lift operators have always maintained a fun and happy attitude which will rub off on you. The bar at the day lodge offered a large selection of spirits and the food served is yummy. There are nice options for lodging nearby like Georgetown Lake Lodge and Fairmont Hot Springs Resort as well as Hotel/Motel options. Your whole family will enjoy the mountain on a lower budget than the other larger ski mountains.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-16,1,"The skiing itself was excellent...uncrowded and good snow. however...\n\nTheir website advertised a price of $30 for college students on the 27th of February. When we arrived they refused to honor this price, siting that it was supposed to be the 28th. When we suggested that we would not be returning the owner shrugged and said he didn't care. We felt very unwelcome and that the $1000+ we'd spent for lodging and skiing wasn't wanted...even though there were roughly 100 people there on a Saturday. BEWARE that the advertised price might not be what they ask for at the window!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-16,3,"We love discovery, the way the owners treat their staff, the great maintenance and care to make it a great experience. Soup with a roll is the ticket in the cafeteria, and don't forget the awesome chocolate chip cookies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan-16,5,"One of the hidden gems of the Big Sky State that only the locals know about. You will be hard pressed to beat this great value of a ski area. Low cost lift pass, virtually no waiting for chair lift, the views are magnificent and you have much room on the slopes to do your thing. Also there are a wide variety of challenging runs to explore. Food is great, too if you choose to eat there on site. Not very far to walk from the parking lot to get your ticket, either. As I say, this is a great place to ski and one of the hidden gems of Montana and the West.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan-16,3,"Discovery has a wide variety of terrain to suit every skier. For more advanced skiers, the terrain off the back has a nice, steep, consistent pitch with runs through the trees, wide groomers or bumps to choose from. The base lodge is nothing fancy but works well and is great for families.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-15,5,"This is one of our favorite places to ski all around Montana. The hill offers the best beginner terrain in the state all the way up to some of the steepest slopes that are lift serviced off the back side, and everything in between. The location gives it consistent snow for most of the season. No snow making so they rely on natural snowfall. Prices are reasonable and there is a lot of terrain so you can find some space to be by yourself. There are future plans to expand to the North giving access directly from Philipsburg rather than having to come all the way up the hill to Georgetown. The restaurant offers a wide variety of options for lunch. Very open and cozy lodge. Well maintained area that is a great place to spend a day. Looking forward to some big dumps of snow to get the ski season rolling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jul-15,4,Discovery is a great family destination - the skiing is terrific for beginners and advanced. Food is offered onsite nearby. The mountain slopes are beautiful and steep.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Apr-15,3,This ski area is our family favorite place to ski. The run are wide open. People are so friends There is levels for every one skiing level. We make this trip one a year and I love every minute of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-15,3,"I regret passing Disco Basin on I90 too many times, that won't happen again-vertical, value, terrain, high altitude snow reliability and a bowl to humble the best. Thank goodness there are low key mountain resorts like this where the roots of riding live. If you are a local, you're blessed with this gem and probably know it. Thanks for sharing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,,4,"Nice ski area with great value, great staff, good food, and lots of varied terrain. Beautiful place, don't expect high speed lifts otherwise it wouldn't be the value it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan-15,4,"Great Mountain with all kinds of terrain for families! We love it here and our kids are learning to ski here. The types of runs have allowed our kids to gain confidence and ski on their own in just 1.5 seasons. The lift staff on Sunday's is the best. Especially the staff on the Easy Chair Lift. So kind and supportive of all the people and kids learning to ski. The lodge isn't anything to write home about from a beauty standpoint, but it gets the job done. Food, hot chocolate and good beer with friends and family. Oh and its warm. You can bring your own lunch and eat it in the lower section of the lodge where there are tables and booths. The ski school staff is great, friendly and perfect for young kids learning to ski. They are all young college-age staff and so you get that type of lesson. The drive is easy from surrounding towns and your best bet is to get there early to get a good parking spot and get early runs in!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-15,4,"What a fun family day on the Mountain. Our first trip to Discovery, the only bad thing I have to say is please have more signs marking your establishment, it was difficult to find or know that you were heading the right way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan-15,3,"This is a great small ski hill! Most runs were open and it wasn't too crowded. Needed to be groomed but due to the rain, it was impossibile to make the conditions good. I like the small town feel and the small crowd. The bar made a great bloody mary and I heard the soups are great!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan-15,3,"This is a great mountain for kids learning to ski. The bunny hill chair lift is low enough that kids can ride it themselves with no problem. The restaurant in the lodge is not staffed well during weekends, so we stood in line to get lunch for 25 min. Next time, we will bring a sack lunch in our backpack or eat earlier to beat the crowds. \n\nThe ski rental place also gets really, really busy in the mornings. We recommend getting there right when they open at 9am if you are planning to rent skis because the line for rentals is super long by 10am on the weekends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Dec-14,3,"Nothing fancy, just an all around good ski hill. No lift lines and the snow was great. Good service with a friendly staff. Reasonably priced. The lodge serves food at reasonable prices and micro brews are available. Nice mix of runs on the front side, mostly double diamonds on the back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-14,5,"This is my all time favorite ski resort. Nothing fancy.... Just great skiing, no lines.... And very reasonable prices! I spend my entire winter here!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan-14,3,"This is the place to be if you like short lines, wide open runs &amp; value for your money. We came from Florida with our 9 &amp; 10 year olds and they had a blast. One day in ski school, less than $100 for both, and they were riding the greens down the next day with no fear. Ski and stay packages were just under $100 for 2 adults in Anaconda. If they had ski in &amp; out on the mountain I would give the place a perfect 10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-14,4,"My wife and I recently moved to Anaconda and are really psyched to have this incredible amenity so close by. Discovery is not Aspen or Sun Valley, thank god. Varied terrain, thoughtful and friendly staff, great food, and just a good vibe. Also an incredible value. Prices for lift tickets, equipment rental, lesson, food, etc. are beyond reasonable. My wife (who had never skied in her life) took a private lesson with Becky and was making turns at the end of the first hour. Becky was very professional and made the learning process smooth and fun. We have already bought season tickets and look forward to spending a lot more time on the mountain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-14,5,"We enjoyed a wonderful day skiing with family who live in Anaconda. The value ($40) is fantastic. The facilities are simple, the chairlifts rather slow, but the terrain is great and varied. Sadly, many of the runs end with a long flat ski-out to the lift - a problem if there's a lot of snow. Very friendly staff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan-14,4,I thought it was really nice of Discovery to run the lifts for me when I went to visit them on Tuesday and Wednesday. There were a couple locals on the front side of the mountain but I felt like I had my own private ski resort for two days! The terrain on the back side was amazing and even though it didn't snow while we visited I was still finding powder stashes two days after the last storm. The grooming on the front side is crazy. I don't think I have ever skied on a groomed run as steep as sluce box. How do they even get the cats up that hill? I don't know that I could spend a week straight skiing here but for a couple of days it is definitely worth the forty dollars I paid for the lift ticket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-13,5,"Discovery is very cool. Fun, lively, friendly, local vibe. The front side of the mountain is entirely covered in groomers for those in the beginner and intermediate levels. The terrain park is good for the type of resort that Discovery is. The staff are mostly all friendly individuals. The back side of the mountain is super awesome. Laced with double black diamonds, it is super fun to ski. It's especially awesome on power days because there is no grooming on the back side. The only problem is the positioning of the lifts forces you to hike a little ways in certain situations. But the food was good, and the prices for everything were reasonable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-17,3,"Well, we caught Disco with plenty of snow and sunshine for our 3 days in early March. Grooming was better than in the past. What a great ski hill. Folks have no idea how big thia place really is. Exceptional value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-17,3,"We have skied all over the Pacific Northwest and find that Discovery is our favorite. We are weekday skiers so find that we can ski right up to the lift and make another great run. The groomers do a stellar job of smoothing the slopes and the broad expanses on many runs make it seem like you have the hill to yourself. \n\nI am a blue, blue/black level skier and my partner loves the black runs. We both find plenty of areas to satisfy without getting bored.\n\nThis ski area can ""absorb"" lots of skiers without it feeling cramped or crowded. We are so impressed we plan to get a season pass for the 2017/2018 season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-17,4,"We love skiing at Discovery Mountain, the views are breathtaking! The cafeteria makes the best chili bowls and the price won't hurt your pocketbook. We ended the day staying at The Broadway hotel in Phillipsberg, MT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-17,4,There are several great cross country ski trails at the Ski Area. There is a separate parking area for cross country trails before you get to the main ski parking lot. This separate parking area allows access to trails on both sides of the road. Most of the trails were groomed as we skied.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Dec-16,5,"If you like skiing, you owe it to yourself to try Discovery when you're in Montana. It's a little off the beaten path, but you won't regret driving the Pintler Scenic Route to get there. Amazing steeps on the backside on a powder day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan-17,5,"We had a great time at Discovery Ski area as part of a ski and stay package at Fairmont HotSprings. We loved the mountain though there was not much snow it was still groomed and fit our needs. The kids both did lessons which they enjoyed but was a little hectic on checkin for kinderski (I think they aren't used to being that busy, it was a holiday weekend) my daughter loved it. They somehow lost my sons reservations (which was strange because they were booked together) then they made us wait in the rental line which was 40 minutes long and made him late for the class. He was grouped with kids much younger than him and he said it was really slow moving...it was only his second time skiing so Im sure this is why they put him in this group but dont feel that we got what we paid for with his lesson. I must say that the person who we did get at the rental line was great and once we told him we were sent over there and had to wait in line he got my son right through so he could make it to his class asap. He even followed up with me to make sure he made it. I was impressed. All the guys (minus the one that misinformed us to get in line) were awesome and moving as fast as they could to get through the line. I would like to visit Discovery again on a non holiday weekend as I think that we might have had a very different expierence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Dec-16,5,"About ten years ago, after watching a segment of the NBC television program ""The Today Show"" I booked a flight to Missoula and ""discovered"" Discovery Mountain, just a few miles from Philipsburg Montana. As a lifelong skier I yearned to find a mountain that I felt I could ski till I was ninety and not be bored or disappointed. Disco, as the locals call it, has not disappointed. If you feel some nostalgia for the simpler days of skiing, where every run brought a sense of wonder and joy, without the glitz of a hundred dollar plus ticket, and a view that stretches for what seems a hundred miles give Disco a try. True, the lifts are slow, the amenities somewhat sparse, but that adds to the charm of an area whose values are that of a family, yet whose back side slopes are as challenging as any I've skied in sixty plus years. The spirit is willing but the knees are weak. \n\nDiscovery has slopes for every skier, the extreme to gentlest of beginners and rates that can't be beat. The cafeteria is more than adequate and the bar serves local beer. The nearby accommodations range from modest to The Ranch at Rock Creek a Relais et Chateau, ""guest"" ranch, a five star ultra exclusive venue. In between options are the very unique Broadway Hotel, and a newcomer The Caledonian Inn, both charming and a good value, I have enjoyed stays at both. \n\nBut I digress, for it was Discovery that prompted my move to Montana and it is Discovery whose slopes never fail to delight that keeps me here, in the Flint Creek valley in the shadow of the Pintler Range. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. You might even end up moving here, but then again don't. I prefer an empty endless slope of powder, with a bluebird sky alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan-16,5,"Great ski area for Southern Montana. My husband really enjoyd his day of skiing. The lodge has a shope for mittens, hats and gloves etc. and yu can rent skis there. Several trails from beginner to diamond. Great day!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-16,5,"I always enjoy making a trip to Discovery regardless of the conditions. The terrain is great, it often feels like you have the whole mountain to yourself, and the lifties are always smiling... But this trip, I finally lucked out and got two days of POW! I wish I didn't have to leave!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-16,3,"Was here for a ski race. Race was well run even though the snow wasn't cooperating. Great value and family vibe. Better food than Big Sky's cafeteria. And, as is typical in Montana, everyone was nice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,,3,"This is a great place to learn, a beginner and for kids/family. They pay attention to the slopes. If you see something wrong, or someone who may be hurt they are on top of things. Great place for a day out!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan-12,3,We took our 6th and 7th grade classes to Discovery for a field trip and it was excellent. It was not crowded at all and the rates were reasonable. There are plenty of runs and they have some jumps for snowboarders. The lodge was spacious and had plenty of food and tables.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-11,4,"We skied Discovery Basin this winter again, and we like the place because of the short lift lines and the friendliness of the operators and staff. Spring skiing is better than pre-New Year's Day.\n\nLift tickets are inexpensive for a half day at $29. If you have a pass from any other Montana ski area you get the full-day pass for a half-day rate. And seniors 65+ ski for $19. We like that!\n\nThe chalet is redone with on-premise burgers and salads and the bar is always good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-11,2,"Went on Sunday, March 6... had to park over 1/2 mile away, 5-10 min liftlines on painfully slow lifts at base area, old snow, poor grooming, and alot of walking to get to runs off the top. Not what I expected from a small MT ski area that was hyped to be alot of fun and empty.\n\nterrain on the back looked great.. nice and steep, but only if you hit it on a powder day, as it was all bumped and/or scraped off. Groomers were scraped off and inconsistent texture..\n\noh, and the line for the mens restroom was 8 deep.. while people were dressing their kids in the stalls and tightening their ski boots.. reminded me of CA on this day. Not fun.\n\nThat being said, I bet it's a much better experience on a less busy day and with good snow.. so give it a shot if in the area, but don't drive 2 hrs just to go there like we did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,,3,Great lift ticket prices. Kidsa had a great time. Small lift lines. Will go back!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-13,5,"Discovery Ski Area is well known in Western Montana for the great variety of ski runs it offers and family atmosphere. Discovery has great cruiser trails and also offers very steep expert terrain. You'll find something for everybody. Nearby lodging is limited, but many people enjoy staying in nearby Philipsburg, Anaconda, or Fairmont Hot Springs. You'll always have a great day of skiing at a reasonable price at Discovery. Oh, and season passes are about the price of three days of skiing at the larger, more crowded resorts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-13,5,"For $40 bucks, its an amazing deal for the acreage, the long runs, and variety of terrain. You can run down double blacks all day on one chair, or cruise along several of their long groomed blues. The lodge is wide open up top so its not hard to find people, but on the flip side they really don't have a 'bar scene'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-13,5,"We learned to ski here 25 years ago when it was $9?a lift ticket. Now after a week in Fernie BC we drive through for old time sake. Still great snow , long runs with perfect conditions and no lines to get on. All that for $40 lift tickets. The best skiing secret in USA .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-13,5,Super Friendly Staff. Beautiful views and long runs. Uncrowded slopes. Great prices. No lift lines. Great food. Great lodge. Good access.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan-13,5,"We spent a day at the Discovery Ski Area recently, and while a couple of us choose not to ski/snow board, those that did had a blast. There are several runs to choose from for all skill levels and ski/snow board equipment rentals are available. The cost is average for this type of activity. They could use a few more toilets and sinks in the restrooms to cut down on the line a bit. The eating area, while fairly large, was jammed packed with an outrageous line between noon and 2:30 or so, and it seemed the staff were a bit slow. I observed one gal barbequeing burgers that handles the money and the burgers one right after the other with her bare hands; no gloves, and no hand washing. That was a bit disturbing to me. The food in my opinion was a bit over priced, but I guess that is to be expected when you go to a place like this. There appeared to be adequate parking. They had a fairly large deck with outdoor seating for those needing to rest a bit but wanting to enjoy the action. The view was outstanding. All in all, it was a beautiful day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb-12,3,"If you want great skiing without a big expense, head to Discovery. It is a bargain from lift tickets to food in the restaurant. You can find any kind of terrain at Discovery. Just remember double black diamonds ARE double black diamonds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-12,3,Loved that it was very kid friendly and not at all crowded. Prices very reasonable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Dec-11,5,"This is the Mountain we snowboarded on and we totally fell in love with it, we love to do a few hours of boarding and a few hours of drinking and this was just perfect we boarded till 2 or 3 then went and had some of the best Clam chowder I have ever had ugh it was so dang good I think its because they used dill. I think about that chowder all the time. After the AMAZING chowder oh I forgot to mention the BEST chocolate chip cookie I ever had it was like a mix of a muffin and a cookie together it was thick and moist and chocolity! After all the food we sat at the bar and the bartender was so nice! She was super kind and friendly we loved Discovery!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar-12,5,"Never, ever, ever a line, affordable tickets, not crowded and nicely groomed. There's everything from nice, wide cruisers to double black diamond, through-the-trees teeth rattlers. It was the best skiing ever and we actually stayed a day longer it was so good. Don't bother with the expensive places if you really want to ski - this place has it all!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-13,5,"Overall it was a very good resort by our limited standards. The lifts were all running, the equipment and facilities were on par with most of the bigger ski resorts also. We only had an afternoon to get a few runs in and being so close we were able to not waste time driving to and from the bigger resort at Big Sky.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-12,5,What can I say GREAT place for anyone who loves the outdoors. Skiing is awesome! Their instructors are all awesome. Just a short drive from Bozeman.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-13,5,"Basic Info: Adult lift tickets for a full day are $49, although it's only $40 if you buy your lift ticket after 12:30 pm. Lift tickets for children and seniors are cheaper. The slopes close at 4 pm, at least on Fridays. The main lodge has a cafe, and there is a small gift shop located inside the rental office. Both lodges have locker rentals for 50 cents, and full-sized seasonal lockers are available for season rental. The parking lot is much larger than I expected, but after my visit (on a Friday afternoon) I realized that the place is probably packed on the weekends, with parking spots hard to come by. \n\nIf you are any skiing experience, you might as well skip the rest of my review because I am far from an expert skier- more like a good skier that is now many years out of practice. But Bridger Bowl has lots of slopes to choose from. There is a bunny slope which is fairly flat, but also very narrow considering it's full of kids learning to ski and people trying to figure out how to turn left and right. But it's a good place to get started. Sunnyside Trail is probably the next easiest trail. After that, they seem to get slightly more difficult, and I'm not going to presume to be able to rate the difficulty or comparability since I consider myself to be a novice (again).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-12,4,"We love skiing Bridger Bowl! We usually only go skiing once a year (no hills near Fargo, ND!), and used to vary trips between Bridger Bowl and Big Sky/Moonlight. Bridger is obviously a smaller ski resort than Big Sky, but for the price and the customer service, it's hard to beat, especially if you use the Powerhound Package deal. There are a good variety of runs for Beginner and Intermediate skiers, and it looks like there are good runs for experts too, but we don't go on the expert-only lift up to the ridge (as I mentioned, we ski once/year!). There are a few black runs you can access from the mid-mountain lifts, so you can have a little adventure without committing to something crazy. The skiing at Bridger is always good, but what really stands out is their customer service. I'm not sure what kind of customer service training they do there, but it works! Everyone from the reservations people (so helpful!!), to the rental shop guys (again, really helpful), to the lifties (always in a good mood), to the servers in Jimmy B's restaurant (great service - especially from Larry!) are happy and helpful and glad you are there. Even the guys in the first aid cabin are great. Even if you don't need them, they have cool t-shirts for sale to support the rescue dogs! We also enjoy the other skiers at Bridger - they attract a much more friendly, down-to-earth crowd than Big Sky. If you fall down and have a ""yard sale"", there are always a bunch of people stopping to help and making sure you're ok. Embarrassing, but nice! Another nice advantage to skiing Bridger is staying in Bozeman. Lots of good restaurants, cool college town vibe, awesome co-op, etc. There are also a variety of nice places to stay at varying price points. We prefer the C'Mon Inn for the nice rooms, breakfasts, and multiple hot tubs. Hope you enjoy your time at Bridger. Tell Larry at Jimmy B's we said ""hi""!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-13,2,"Dress warm for this gem in the rough. Don't get me wrong I love the mountain it just needs a few fixes. Please add a buss from the parking lots well below the base lodge. add a high speed lift from the bottom so that when the wind blows (and it always blows) you get out of it faster. And lastly fix your anamometer, If I had known it was actually 20MPH I would not have driven up, I would have gone to nearby Yellowstone's North end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-12,4,"I would rather board up at Big Sky, Moonlight, or Discovery any day over Bridger. Once I learned the mountain I began to like it, a few years ago when I lived in Bozeman I was really not a fan of it, but it is decent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-13,3,"Bridger is a decent mountain that is only 15 miles from downtown Bozeman. There is a good sized bunny hill for the beginners and lots of intermediate terrain. For the more extreme skiiers, bring your transceiver and shovel to hike the ridge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-12,4,Terrain for all level of skiers. Friendly staff and lots of fun! Highly recommend for families or anyone who likes to ski.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-13,5,"This place is is about 60% of the cost of nearby Big Sky. It's obviously a much smaller place, but it's fun and a great opportunity to try a different hill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-12,4,"Writing a review for Bridger Bowl is difficult for me. After all, I'm a local and I go there. So really, I don't want to see it get any more crowded. But you just can't keep secrets these days.\n\nTo me, Bridger is like a throwback to the ""good old days,"" in that the place just seems down home and old-fashioned, which appeals to lots of folks. Of course, some of the ""good old days"" includes riding on ""old-timey"" lifts that take a long time to get up on the mountain. The Powder Park, Virginia City and Pierre's Knob lifts are all very slow.\n\nHere are my main recommendations for having a great time at Bridger: 1) If possible, don't go on the weekend. If you do then be sure to get there early since the parking lots fill up and you can expect to spend 15-25 minutes just unloading your gear, driving way down to find a parking place, then walking all the way back up to the lodge. You will also find annoying lift lines at the base at the Powder Park lift. 2) Don't go on a rather cold day. This is because the lifts are so slow and you will freeze sitting on them while you crawl up the mountain. Also, when it is busy, the lifts frequently stop and it seems to take a while to start back up. Not fun when it is 10 degrees and the wind is blowing (as it was yesterday while I was there). 3) Don't expect any deals if you have kids in the junior age range. I took my grand daughter who is 13 and had to pay full price. 4) Don't expect any deals if you are a ""senior."" Bridger doesn't give you a break until you are 70 years old. Most resorts I'm familiar with start the discount at around 65.\n\nIf you go to Bridger after some fresh powder it is fantastic. If you go on a weekday when it is not too terribly cold, you will have a great time. The base lodge and mid-mountain lodge are nice to duck into to warm up and get a good meal. Recommendation: it is MUCH easier to find a chair and table at the mid-mountain lodge than at the base on a weekend.\n\nHave fun!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-15,5,"The wide variety of terrain is what makes this hill a wonderful \nDestination!! No accomadation on the hill, there is a 20 min.\nDrive from Bozeman each morning.\nA great hill for all levels of skiers.\nNice restaurants, and 2 bars to choose from.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-15,3,A little bit of everything makes this an enjoyable experience for beginners to experts. Very nice choice of places to eat and drink as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-15,3,"Do not be fooled by the low price (1/2 of Big Sky) this is THE place to ski, weather you want steep and deep or first time terrain. Friendly natives and a great trip. No housing and you ned to drive back to Bozeman each day (16 miles)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,5,"8 lifts -- all modern. The ski rental people are super nice and helpful. If you are an intermediate or beginner skier this place is made for you. If advanced, there is a special area for you- if you are aptly equipped. Prices were awesome today $52 for a full day adult ticket!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-14,5,"We can never get enough of Bridger Bowl! Coming from the east coast you never know what the conditions are going to be but out of the few powder days we ever had most were here. Inexpensive, beautiful mountain with gorgeous snow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-15,5,"Great trails, no lift lines. Conditions were not the best as they had not had new snow. Will definitely be back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-15,5,The snow when we were there was excellent. There is a very good choice of runs for all levels of skiers. There are also an abundance of lodges both at the base and on the hill. The prices are the lowest of any ski hills in this class.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-15,5,"Bridger Bowl is a class act from beginning to end! I have skiied for nearly 40 years at many resorts throughout the U.S. I regularly ski in Colorado. My experience at Bridger was the best. Everyone I met was friendly, helpful and professional. The skiing was awesome, helped by almost a foot of new powder, but that seemed to only be the icing on the cake. There were no lines - on a powder weekend day!!! There was plenty of variety, and easy to find the way to the various lifts and ski areas. The rental shop, especially the manager, were the best I've seen. Thanks for a great time. I'd go back to Bridger before Big Sky anytime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-14,4,"This is another ski hill we hit on our Montana trip. The entire lower part of the mountain is dedicated to blue and green runs while the top of the mountain is almost exclusively blacks. As a beginner, I appreciated the variety of blues and greens. The blues at Bridger do not seem as steep as the blues at other rocky Mtn ski hills I have been to. My favorite run was Alpine Return/Timmys Road/Summer Road. When skied together, this run will take the better part of 15-20 minutes. And the best part is that you get challenging and fun terrain for the low price of $52 for a lift ticket. That is over $50 less than Big Sky (not that these ski hills are even close to being the same class though). All in all, we had a very fun day at Bridger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-14,3,Ski instructors are very good and again their prices are very reasonable. There are enough ski options on the mountain to make it adventurous without being overwhelming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jul-12,3,"We have been to Big Sky skiing several times and had great skiing. A friend suggested we try Bridger Bowl for a great day of skiing, and we were so glad we took their advice. \nAlthough it is a relatively small ski area, don't let that fool you,.\nThey get great powder, and there are long runs for every level of skier. \nBridger Bowl is such a short drive from Bozeman, we enjoy staying there and being on the ski hill soon. Wouldndefinitelynrecommend to any level of skier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-12,3,"Bridger Bowl is certainly the best ""local"" ski area in the Rockies, and perhaps in the country. The ""cold smoke"" powder days, although rare, cannot be forgotten. Bridger has runs ranging from beginning to extreme (i.e., hike up to the ridge with a partner and other equipment). Bridger has been featured in several movies.\nDon't tell anyone about Bridger because the lift lines are still usually short-to-none, and this is a non-profit ski area: The lift tickets are very reasonable.\nThere is no lodging at the base, although the food is very good. You have to drive (or take a bus) from and to Bozeman, about 20 minutes. Big deal! This is not like Big Sky and/or Moonlight Basin, which are about 45-60 minutes from Bozeman. You might want to ski both areas and compare the experience. The people you meet at Bridger, including locals and others from distant places like Minnesota, North Dakota, and Canada, are usually very friendly and entertaining, at least for a ""local"" like me. Many of my best memories are from Bridger Bowl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-11,4,"We holidayed in Bozeman in December 2011 and had a day skiing at Bridger Bowl. Staff were super helpful to my party of 8 Aussies who didn't ski or have the right gear! Youngest 10 year old benefitted from ski lessons with her own personal trainer. While only a fee ski runs, we had a full day of skiing and the cafe sold superb warm food. Looking forward to returning in 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-12,5,Such an easy place to enjoy a day of skiing. Plenty of challenge but not the big resort attitude.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,May-12,5,Sooooo close to town; only 15 minutes away it is a hidden treasure!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Nov-11,5,"Varied and challenging terrain. No attitudes, just friendly people having fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-12,3,"We added a ski day at Bridger Bowl before heading to Big Sky for a week,and are SO glad we did! It ended up being the 'best day of the year' per one of the regulars there--lots a fresh powder and great conditions. It was actually the best powder skiing day of our week. It was a busy Sunday but lines weren't bad at all. The ticket prices make this a super value. We talked to a family in the clean lodge (good rest rooms) and they absolutely love their local ski spot. We did too--there's something there for everyone!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-12,3,Right from the first phone call to book a trip the ladies were friendly and easy to work with. We made multiple changes on our itinerary and never had an issue. There were no surprises when we arrived other than the depth of the powder that we had to plow through on the hill. We were at Bridger for 4 days and it dumped snow every day. This was one of the best snowboard trip trips I have made.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-11,4,Greatest ski resort in the USA - cool people steep runs and cold smoke.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-12,4,After a foot of new snow overnight skied Bridger Bowl on a bluebird Montana day. Whille it was crowded for here..I still had fresh tracks at noon in 3Bears Bowl. \nThe 'cold smoke' is legendary dry powder that makes skiing memorable. It is a quintessential Rocky mountain ski resort without the glitz and glamor...just honest pricing and incredible skiing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-19,5,"My 12 year old son had 5 days of private lessons twice daily. We really got to know John Saam. He has awesome people skills, and helped him go from learning to stop and turn to spending the last two days on Green runs. My son developed confidence in his ability to ski. I followed close behind. If you want to learn to ski and are headed to Bridger Bowl. John Saam is a must! You will love his style &amp; patience.\n\nAs well, you will love the women in the Ski School office. Peggy, Jennifer &amp; Shannon are fantastic. Fantastic week!!! Remember, John Saam - The King of all that's skiing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-19,5,"From the staff to the slopes, this place is one of the best kept secrets! The lift tickets are reasonable compared to other area ski places. The ski/snowboard rentals were fairly priced as well. Many slopes to experience and explore. We did not get bored skiing/snowboarding here and we skied 4-7 days. We had a personal dilemma that the staff handled so kindly and professionally. It was a great experience!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Oct-19,4,"Our University hosts took us out to Bridger Bowl for dinner as part of our site visit. The place was remarkably empty (not snowy enough for skiing and too snowy for summer sports), so we had the place to ourselves. The lodge was a good dinner venue, with considerable variety in beers and plenty decent food. I'd like to see it in full operation at some point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Aug-19,5,"We were guests at a private affair in late August. The food was excellent, bar choices ample, and the ambience lovely. The room is spacious enough to hold a couple hundred guests and we were by no means crowded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Aug-19,3,"What a find. I‚Äôm recommending this quaint ski destination to my sons. How nice to find a family friendly resort that isn‚Äôt so mammoth you feel like you are competing with the world. Only 16 miles up the hill from Boseman, many lifts to offer variety. Wish I still could ski and I‚Äôd definitely go back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-19,3,Had a pass this year and was absolutely blessed. The beauty is unsurpassed. The runs are so outstanding. The people are lovely. The warming huts are inviting and a great place to visit. You won't ski many more wonderful places.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr-19,4,"Great place. I took the group lessons both sessions . The teachers were amazing , patient, kind, talented and fun. The kitties were polite, bathrooms clean. It certainly had plenty of skiing for our family. \nBeautiful scenery and close to town. For me it was wonderful. \nThe restaurants had decent prices and food was fine- typical pub food. Great beer selection too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-19,3,"I dislike all the big mega resorts with their arrogant attitudes and exorbitant prices. If you feel similar go to Bridger Bowl. It is only 16 miles outside of Bozeman, but you do not see the resort until you are about 0.5 miles away. It has the most natural appearance and feeling of all resorts I have visited. There is ample amount of skiing terrain for the majority of skiers for a few days and if you are an expert, you just hit the jackpot. Don't forget your avi beacon if you decide to go to the expert level ridge terrain. Food prices are reasonable with hamburgers at $4 and great taco salad at $10. Tasty food as well.\nOnly con is that it aims for local clientele. Very few signs and directions at resort of where to go to park, drop off area and how to go to hit slopes, etc. Hey, but if I must act confused or ask questions so be it. Loved this place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-18,4,"I got to know Bridger Bowl when I was in graduate school years ago. It was a quick 20+ minutes from Montana Hall to the mountain. The hill offers some tough terrain, some good moguls, a park at the top, and lots of diversity. Further, Bridger Bowl was the home many years for the college national downhill skiing championship. People are friendly, the skiing is good, and it's reasonably priced. Try Bridger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-19,5,My daughter and I went here and took some lessons. The staff from the very beginning were so nice to deal with. They made sure we had everything we needed and were very nice. The pricing is very fair especially for people who are just starting the ski journey. Overall we had a great time and were impressed with the service here. We would recommend this place to beginners for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-11,3,"We skied here 1 out of our 4 days skiing and enjoyed it more than Big Sky. For $47, you can't beat this as compared to $81 for Big Sky ($77 online). Nice little place, but after a day we had skied most everything.\n\nIf you're in the area, you need to try out Bridger Bowl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-11,3,"Value was decent at $50 for lift ticket and $25 rentals. Good variety of skiing. Dining options were good considering this is a community owned ski area.\n\nLift guys could possibly be a bit more courteous since we arent all expert skiers. A few miles outside Bozeman but no big deal, just be careful driving if very early in the mornings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,4,"I've skiied Bridger Bowl in 2001, 2003 &amp; 2006. This place never fails to please with great snow and short waits in line. I've skiied a few places in Tahoe and the East Coast, plus a few in Montana--Big Sky &amp; Moonlight Basin--but Bridger is always my favorite. The lift ticket price is reasonable, the locals who frequent the place are so friendly and the staff is very cool. This ski slope has something for everyone from beginner to expert and it's not far from downtown Bozo. If I had to pick a place to go back to over and over again, I'd pick Bridger Bowl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,5,"My husband, two sons (ages 9 and 11) and I visited Bridger Bowl and skiied for four days over the New Year's holiday. We researched this place on Trip Advisor and their website and it looked like a low-key, family friendly place for beginning skiers. Well, we were right!\n\nWe're used to skiing in California, which is generally crowded when the conditions are good. But at Bridger there was never a line, the snow was amazing, everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful, including the other skiers, the prices were very reasonable and we had a fantastic experience.\n\nI especially recommend this place for families with young children who are looking to introduce them to skiing. The staff-to-patron ratio is amazing. My kids and I took a ""group"" lesson and we each got our own instructor. My older son decided to switch from snowboard to skis on the second day - no hassles. We just went to the rental shop and they swapped him out. There is a very good selection of runs for the very beginning to the very advanced, so those who want more of a challenge won't be disappointed. The lodges have good food, reasonably priced and are really clean and scenic looking facilities. The mountain views are beautiful.\n\nThere isn't much loding immediately adjacent, but there is plenty of lodging in Bozeman, which is just 16 miles away. The drive is an easy one and the road is always plowed. There is also a bus that will take you to Bridger from Bozeman for free if you don't want to drive.\n\nI really can't recommend this place enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,4,"Awesome! i'm the worst skier ever, yet i had a blast. this is a must for everyone! skis and snowboards are available at amazing rental costs. bring your warm clothes 'cause it gets chilly! have fun!\n",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,5,"From begining to end Bridger Bowl is the best and least expensive ski area in MT. I've been to Big Sky and Bridger and if you're interested in some serious powder runs without the crowd hassle, got to Bridger Bowl.... It's Awesome..\n",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jul-12,4,"Attended son's wedding in July 2012, held at the mid-hill lodge. Easily accessible facility big enough for several hundred at least. Tables, chairs, etc included in the rental fee so you don't have to rent and haul them. Catering also did a great job. A most ""Montana"" place that our out-of-state guests enjoyed. Only caution: warn your guests to bring flat soled shoes to wear if the ceremony is held out on the deck, which is made of grating (so that snow will fall through during ski season). The grating eats high heels!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-12,3,"We have had mid-week season passes to BB for the past several years. When we first arrived in Bozeman, I thought, well, we might ski here occasionally. But skiing one or two days a week all season really improved our skiing. The treed routes (they are not official runs) are what MAKE the mountain for us. And of course, there is always the Ridge to move up too, once you get good enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jul-12,4,"Bridger Bowl claims its a world class community ski hill. It delivers everything it promises. Granted I might be bias seeing how this is where I learned to ski, but it offers something for every level of Skier. Alpine Meadows lift is the perfect lift for folks just learning. Slushmans is every skiers backcountry wet dream. Only down side to Slushmans is lines on powder days. If your in Bozeman for a ski trip and are skiing Big Sky and Moonlight, do yourself a favor and take a day or three up to Bridger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-14,5,"We had an amazing time at Bridger. They have slopes for all levels and their prices are really affordable.

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-14,5,"We stayed and skiied 4 days over Christmas and New Years. We were blessed with excellent conditions and fantastic skiing. Even during the holidays new lift options kept line very short and there was a nice variety of terrain to explore. Lodge facilites were stupendous and prices reflect the non profit nature. This place is awsome for family skiing and we were entertained each day with the sights of the Ridge Runners desending the chutes and traverses. We very much enjoyed the live music, fireworks and torchlight parade the evening before New Years. The resort is very close to Bozeman...about a fifteen minute drive... but, the curves at the beginning of the canyon deserve respect. Get there early and you are rewarded with premium parking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-13,5,"Bridger Bowl, located a mere twenty minutes from Bozeman Montana, is a great ski area. Bridger has eight ski lifts. With these lifts, you can access terrain that works for any level of ability. More often then not, lines are short or non-existent. Rarely, you will have a moderate lift line, usually on powder days. You can ride up Bridger Lift and then hike onto the Ridge of this mountain. Tons of unmarked runs off expert level can be reached off of the Ridge. They range from steep chutes to wide open powder fields. In my opinion, the best part of this local ski area is the vibe it carries. Everyone is friendly and as stoked to be there as you will be. I ski there all the time, and I love every minute I spend on the mountain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-13,3,Great terrain for a medium size Mountain. Location is 16 miles from Bozeman so stay in Bozeman and drive!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-13,3,I work up at Bridger and am always stoked on powder days. Schlushmens lift brings you to some rad steeps and plentiful powder skiing. Love this hometown resort. Don't forget your apres ski/board beer at Jimmy B's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr-13,5,great skiing at a hill close to Bozeman. Takes only 30 minutes (if that) to drive there. Great snow and runs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-13,5,"Great mountain and fine folks. No overnight accommodations, unless you check with Bridger Bowl's central reservations. Those folks will set you in the right direction and they will also book lift tickets, lessons, rentals, even daycare sessions with ski lessons for the little tykes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-13,4,"We are so grateful for this local ski hill that serves families and extreme skiers alike. Reasonable prices, brown-bag friendly lodge, and beginner slope make it great for families. An avalanche transceiver and shovel open up endless extreme terrain. FUN!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-12,4,"Bridger's snow is crappy and so are the people. Go to Showdown, located about 2 hours north near Monarch and Neihart. They have champagne powder and every one has a smiling face. Never a line either. Amazing!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,4,"Bridger Bowl is a gem. Short lines, usually tons of snow, cheap tickets and almost zero commercialization. A non-profit hill that ranks on many top 20 lists. Bozeman is a great place to spend a week (or longer) and is only 16 miles or so from Bridger. What are you waitng for?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-11,4,"IN Plato‚Äôs allegory of the cave, the famous philosopher describes humanity as living in an unenlightened cave, blind to the true, epicurean pleasures of life, waiting to be led out of their wretched existence. Wretched is the word I would use to accurately describe East Coast skiing, days of ice and slippery slopes, impossible to find traction or garner thrill from truly challenging slopes. When my parents put me on a plane to Montana with my siblings, I was being led out of my metaphorical cave of tepid and halfhearted downhill. For the first time at Bridger Mountain, I was experiencing truly challenging skiing.\n\nOur arrival at the slopes was shortly accompanied by three feet of powder fall, as the temperature drop to under ten degrees, perfect snow for skiing in. Heaven is the only word for it, heaven with a few numbed extremities. It was almost ethereal. The enjoyment of it was blinding, racing through waist deep powder.\n\nBridger Mountain is also different from other resorts in that it is less of a resort and more of a heavily ski based lodge and slopes. The sheer size of the mountain was amazing. There are nearly three times as many runs as the local slopes in my native Cincinnati, and the large majority are black diamonds, with a hefty section of double-black diamonds too. But if fast is not your style, there are long winding greens and blues to choose from too. Even if I had become bored with those slopes there is still the backwater skiing through the uncharted west side of the mountain through Slashman‚Äôs Canyon and Mundy‚Äôs Bowl, the truly untouched areas.\n\nThe lodge is cozy too, with a well-supplied cafeteria and nearby lodging for those who want to stay on site, but there are also places to stay and eat of the slopes. And if you get tired of skiing altogether there is still Bozeman, a small city thirty away.\n\nFrom the slopes to the service, Bridger Bowl in Montana has truly opened my eyes to the joys of skiing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-12,5,Snow was a bit sparse (very unusal for this time of year) but we had great fun and the sunshine made up for the lack of snow!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-11,5,This is the best place to ski. The lift opp's are super friendly with the little kids. There is plenty of terrain for everyone from the begginger to the advanced. This is a east facing mountain range so it holds its snow extremely well. Rent the proper eq. and find someone to take you to the ridge if you are a good skier. We do the Powder Hound package. This is the best place to take your family for a great ski vacation without taking out a loan...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-11,5,"We skied over Xmas 2011 since not enough to open all lift we got tickets for $20! For us, we are beginner/intermediate skiers so the lifts that were open were perfectly fine for us. Plus two beautiful lodges to eat lunch in. What a hidden gem this ski resort is. Not too crowded, no wait on the ski lifts. Would highly recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,5,"Every time I've gone there (about 10 times each year, for the last 7 yrs) the trails are well groomed, they have lots of terrain, and they're adding more, and the people are nice. Why I like them more than Big Ski is because one year I went to Big Sky and the said they had a 72"" base, BUT THEY LIEDüò°!!! I spent the whole day either skiing in slush or on rocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-11,4,"Montana has had little snow this year, but our trip to Bridger Bowl was still a fun day on the slopes. The lines were almost ZERO wait all day long.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-11,5,"Big Sky is expensive and chi-shi. BB is the place is where the locals like to ski. Prices are fair and the place is owned by the taxpayers, not some fancy California corporation. Located in a scenic valley much closer to the downtown and airport.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Nov-11,4,"great place, very extremely challenging. always has snow, great town, and lodging, great food, pubs, whatever you need. only 16 miles up the canyon rd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-20,4,"This is rated as one of the best skiing experiences anywhere by more than one magazine‚Äî&amp; many people ‚Äúin the know‚Äù! It‚Äôs BEAUTIFUL! Shuttles are available from Bozeman, which make it very convenient because parking is quite limited, by design.\n\nIn summer months, this is a beautiful area to drive &amp; hike, too‚Äîjust be sure to wear good hiking shoes &amp; always carry plenty of water &amp; BEAR SPRAY.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-20,4,"It's hard to beat the combo of great skiing, less than hour from Bozeman, laid back atmosphere and great pricing. From extreme to beginner, you will find what you want. Plus, they have had many updates to lifts in recent years. I almost hate to write this review because I love no lift lines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-20,5,"I love BB! Easy to get there, convenient parking and set up. Pricing was what I expected - around $100 for ticket &amp; gear for the day. Very efficient getting outfitted with equipment. I didn't wait on a lift the entire day - ski up and get on. I know my limits and stay on the easy to intermediate runs and there were plenty. Great variety and no surprises. Lunch was reasonable and efficient. All around great day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-20,5,"Bridgers 1st Steeps Clinic was awesome. The Ski School set these clinics up perfectly with the Steeps first, then Intro to Ridge, to Ridge tactics. Bridger is my favorite place because it‚Äôs like my home hill, only longer, and steeper. I plan on going back next year, maybe twice for the Ridge. Th@nks Joe and Crew!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-20,4,"Hit this mountain on a powder day, a Friday. Had a great day, staff was friendly, mountain has tons of variety, they were quite busy but lines were very manageable. Will certainly ski here again",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-20,5,"I'm not much of snow boarder (nor ski person), however, it was the best one I ever visited.\nComing from Los Angeles, I've been Bigbear, Mammoth, Charleston in Vegas, and a few smaller places. \nThis place is definately better. \nWe stopped by on the way to Yellowstone North gate as we had couple extra days. Loved it, so returned after Yellowstone visit.\nIt has several bigining courses for my boys and biginning/intermediate course which was not too scary for beginner but long enough to enjoy the ride.\nWe even thought about flying from Los Angeles in future just for the snowboard/ski.\n",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-20,5,"My husband and I bought a midweek ski package from Bridger Bowl. This included skiing at Bridger and staying at the Element in downtown Bozeman. We loved both experiences and highly recommend this package! Fern Corwin from Bridger coordinated the details. She was so kind and easy to contact and we even got to meet her in person when we were at Bridger. If you can get away for midweek skiing this is the BEST- no crowds, no lift lines, and lunch at Alpine cabin mid mountain.\nThe Element has a lobby breakfast that is beautiful and bountiful and also a relaxing happy hour . We plan to return next winter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-19,5,"Nice drive from Bozeman. Our 1st trip here for Family ski trip with adults, teens &amp; small kids, this was perfect for all. Really liked the kids fenced area to warm up or learn to ski with small lift, this is nice. The staff at all of the lifts were great &amp; kind. Great runs for all the family from black to beginner. Decent price for lifts, thank you. The only problem we had was finding a seat at lunch, all lodges were very full. We will definitely ski here again!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-19,5,"Someone we know recommended Bridger Bowl because it had good skiing and it was economical (if that word can be used when taking a family skiing) compared to other resorts in the Rockies. We spent 10 days in Bozeman through Christmas and had a great time. The skiing is really good and is a bit of a hidden gem as long as you have not been spoiled by some of the resorts that offer high speed, heated lifts and ski in/out villages at the bottom of the mountain. We've enjoyed those amenities also but going this time of year also impacts the cost of lift tickets quite a bit. We paid $65 which was $100 less/ticket than Big Sky. Big Sky is 50 miles south of Bozeman, it offers all the things you can imagine in a ski resort and you will pay dearly for everything. Bridger Bowl is a no frills mountain. It does have one small cafe 1/2 way down one of the runs and a couple of places at the bottom of the mountain to get grilled food. There Is no logging on the mountain. You drive in each day or there's a bus that runs from Bozeman which is about 20 minutes away. You'll need something other than an American Express to pay because they don't accept that card. In spite of the sparce accommodations we really enjoyed ourselves. The skiing is great and the runs were not crowded at all. I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try as long as you're good with simple and not looking for the total resort experience. You'll definitely save some money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-19,3,The hill is very heavily used and ridden that it was ruts/ice from people‚Äôs boards. Biggest problem is they need more snow (not their fault). Lots of very nice people to talk to. The lodge and bar were completed packed and it was hard to find anywhere to sit. Overall a good day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-17,4,"Bridger Bowl is an amazing ski area, great runs, close to Bozeman and reasonable prices. Beautiful setting and easy access. Definitely a must ski area!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-17,4,"The signage to get to the ski rental place was confusing, but once we were there we foudn excellent customer service. The slopes were beautiful -- we stayed on the Alpine hill since we are beginnners, and we had a great day!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,5,"Bridger Bowl is a great place to ski and ride. Wide variety of terrain to satisfy any skill level. Laid back, friendly attitude. A very well kept local secret, weekdays almost never have lift lines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-16,5,Our son loves this place. He goes every chance he gets. They do schooling events that the kids cant wait for that is all they talk about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-16,4,A great steep mountain. Usually over looked by big sky but no ones sad about that. Very local spot!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-16,5,"Great skiing, has something for everyone. Good runs. Nice friendly staff. Much smaller than Big Sky and less expensive. Nice in the summer too for day hikes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,5,"Bozeman, has some great skiing. I have 2 girls (10 and 7 ) and thought they'd love to learn to ski during a work trip one year. So we went to Big Sky during spring break. If you've been there, it's amazing! the kids got comfortable and there were not a lot of folks around. Fast forward 1 year, another work trip and I decided to bring the family up too. Big Sky, for it's amazingness, is pretty $$$$. We decided to try Bridger at the behest of the locals. My girls, being girls, freaked out at the lack of familiarity for their 2nd time skiing. I assure you, once they were done, the reviews of Bridger were all 5 star for them. Loved the mountain, the staff was so nice and wonderful and helpful. to me, that's what important. It didn't break the bank, it was good skiing, and my family felt warm and welcome. We'll ski there anytime. Very worth a visit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-15,4,"Great place for skiers of all ages and abilities. I've been skiing here for 32 years, started in college and raised my kids on these slopes. We have skied plenty at Big Sky and Moonlight, but we always come back to Bridger. It's our hometown hill -- lots of variety in the terrain and technical difficulty, plenty of vertical thrills, good prices and great food. Don't miss the fries!! The ski school is top notch and it is just so friendly and convenient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Sep-16,4,I grew up and learned to ski at Bridger. Although it has changed a lot since I was a kid I still like Bridger over Big Sky or any other ski hill in the area. The skiing is fantastic and they have made many improvements in the past 10 years to make the skiing even better. I have been to a few weddings at the Jim Bridger and one at the Deer Park Chalet and those are stunning! I love Bridger and I always will!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-16,3,"There is plenety of sking for all skill levels here and low to no waiting in lines, even weekends. The ski tickets are quite reasonable.

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-21,4,"Once Again Bridger Bowl Skiing was a total blast. John Saams - awesome ski instructor crushed it. We worked with him twice a day for 5 days two years ago, and last week he was terrific as well. Anyone wanting a great ski experience should reach out to Bridger Bowl in Bozeman for ski lessons and wonderful skiing for all levels. Even great skiers would enjoy this local resort. \n\nA shout out to the women in the Ski School office. Peggy, Jennifer &amp; Shannon are fantastic.\n\nJohn Saams - The King of all that's skiing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-22,2,"Took family on 2 seperate days during a vacation to ski at Bridger Bowl- the first day was wonderful-rented from Bridger Bowl-had great equipment and experience but on the next visit-had to rent from Roadhouse Sports-just across parking lot from Bridger Bowl- equipment was faulty and put my kids life at risk- when one child had to walk down mountain because board too small-she returned to rental place- the girl who rented said ""OH I KNEW YOU WOULDNT BE ABLE TO STAY UP BUT OH WELL"" and my other daughters skis would not stay locked to boot appropriately--after 2 rescues from ski partrol- they noted the defective skis and apologized but said it was a bad rental place-both girls never skiied that day and left in tears- WOULD NEVER RENT FROM THEM-they knowingly put MY DAUGHTERS LIFE AT RISK for a rental fee!!!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-21,4,"Purchased all day ski passes online in advance. In theory this should‚Äôve saved time upon arrival. This was the biggest downside of our day at Bridger Bowl. We waited for close to 2 hours to get the passes and rent equipment. Now for the praise: one of our sons got sick after I paid for his equipment and pass. I visited the ski services area and spoke to a manager who transferred his day pass and equipment rental to a different day. The staff also helped us after learning my husband was in a car wreck on his way to pick up two of us, and our shoes were in the damaged vehicle! They found us some lost and found shoes so we didn‚Äôt have to wear socks off property that night. My son and I took the bus service from the ski area to the Bozeman fair grounds and got an Uber from there back to our hotel in Bozeman. Beautiful ski area for all ski levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-21,5,"I've never been skiing before. I booked a snowboard lesson for the morning on a Saturday in March. The instructors were great and there were only 3 people in my group so it was easy to learn the basics. Wish we had more time going down the slopes with the instructors. We basically got 2 turns each, but I understand most of the lesson was learning how to move the board. I would come again. Also, the process with booking reservations online and everything being done with covid procedures went smoothly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr-21,4,"Out of 4 of us, I‚Äôm the skier who sticks to greens because I‚Äôm anxious.\nThis was my idea of a perfect day of skiing. The worst part was the very end by the lifts. Very chill, beautiful views everywhere. My kids and husband had a great day on other runs. 11 yo said ‚Äúbest day skiing ever‚Äù he‚Äôs been to Breckinridge 3 times, and park city - so I‚Äôd say high praise.\nI‚Äôd love to come here again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-21,5,"Snow was amazing, views were amazing, staff was amazing. Simply one of the best ski areas in the U.S. for experienced skiers who like to hang out with, and be around, other skiers. But also very family friendly. Saw as many young families as I saw hard core skiers going off the edge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-21,5,"This was our first time skiing here and it was great. Tons of wide well groomed runs which was nice. Not a lot of people due to covid pre purchase requirements. Not a ton of moguls and what was there was very manageable. My 46 year old legs don‚Äôt appreciate moguls anymore, and most of the resort is groomed so it was enjoyable. To be honest the coverage was a little sparse, but not much the resort can do about that. The drive to the resort was super easy. No scary mountain road drive at all. Good parking and excellent amenities. We didn‚Äôt go up to the top of the ridge at all, but if you are looking for some steep drops and shoots they have it. Adult ticket was $65 I think and my 15 year old was only $40. Excellent experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-20,4,"I grew up skiing on this hill, so it's a special place for me. Usually smaller crowds and certainly cheaper prices than nearby Big Sky. The terrain can be quite challenging if you're prepared to look for it. The only reason I marked a four star was because I went early in the year before enough snow had accumulated and the slopes were a bit ""gravelly"". It will pick up soon and be great skiing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,5,"Compared to some of the other ski hills around the area this place is a heck of a deal! Awesome skiing, more of a skiers hill than snowboarders but either way you will have a good time for a great price!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-14,5,Skip the lines and high prices at Big Sky and enjoy the local flare at Bridger Bowl. I haven't been in 10 years and they have made some wonderful improvements to the chair lifts! I had the best day last week. The ski rentals at the slope were affordable and the staff friendly and knowledgeable. I can't wait to go back to this hidden gem!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,5,"We 've been coming here on and off for about 10 years. We drive all the way from Chicago for week or 10 days of fun on a slopes. We ski here during Christmas/ New Year break and during spring break and both times are great for skiing. Big area and not too many people, a lot of runs for beginners and intermediate. Top part of bowl is too difficult for me. Prices are lower than any ski area around Chicago and half of price of Big Sky. Very friendly staff, great prices for ski lessons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-14,4,"We skied Bridger Bowl twice while staying at Big Sky because the weather was not cooperating with producing snow cover. While we were skiing over rocks at Big Sky, Bridger Bowl was almost completely open with about the same snow cover. The staff was very friendly and the early season rates were very good. There is a good variety of terrain to choose from and no crowds. Bridger Bowl is an easy drive from Bozeman which allows for more of a variety of lodging to choose from. The view from the summit is beautiful also.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-14,3,"This is a local ski slope just outside of Bozeman. Big Sky is 1.5 hours away, but Bridger is 20 minutes.

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Oct-14,5,"This is within easy driving distance of Bozeman, and the steep trails up to the ridge offer spectacular views over the local landscape.

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Sep-14,4,"Service was great but game food on a pizza? Just was not for me. Growler? I'm a city slicker---never heard of one. Saw people carrying this ""jug"" around and ask what is this. Then I bought one!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-13,5,"Bridge, which is co-owned by the city and University, offers a superb, friendly, and challenging opportunity away from the crowds, hustle, and glamor of the big resorts.

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-12,4,"This place used to be a local, amazing, very inexpensive gem. One of the best ski areas I've ever been to. Then either they discovered they could get more $$, Bozeman got too big, people discovered it or whatever, the place is now crowded and expensive. Not as expensive as Big Sky or Teton Village, but those are a billionaire/politician freak shows. Too bad, this place was a gem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-13,5,"In Alberta there is nothing close to this place. No rocks even though it was late in the year. The snow is soft, not like the man made stuff back home. Not for the novice, a lot of excellent expert runs. We in particular liked renting the avalanche transceivers and skied the back side lift. We did encounter a few sheer cliffs and one avalanche that went through a back run earlier, not for the feint of heart!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-13,5,"Visited Bridger Bowl with the intention of taking snowboard lessons during my stay in Bozeman--what a great decision! The prices make skiing/snowboarding accessible even to those on limited budgets, the staff is top-notch, and the lack of lift lines make for an enjoyable on the slopes instead of waiting at the base. There is a variety of terrain and seems to suit all levels from novices up to backcountry skiiers. I worked with Chip, Joe, and Jaime who were all excellent instructors and helped me form a great base of skills and develop confidence in my first few days riding... be warned though, I had such a great experience and developed such a love of winter sports at Bridger that I ended up seeking ski resort employment nearby so I could keep improving on my skills!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-13,2,"For a ski hill its prett lame, especially for montana. There are so many mountains and so much snow. you would think someone would build something to top this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-13,3,"I've skied Bridger a handful of times over the last 15 years and am never disappointed. Short lift lines, great terrain for all levels of skiers and friendly people.

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-13,5,"If you are a traveler that needs some hand holding, likes to have a perfectly served hot meal or needs the bus to pick you up when you park 100 yards away, then please go to Big Sky. It's not far. You'll like it better, and I'll like it better. \n\nIf you're looking to go skiing for the snow - please keep reading. To get a feel for Bridger please consider my favorite North American ski areas... Of course Bridger, but also Loveland, Taos (Thank you Ernie), Alta, A Basin... Real skiers (ie - people who really want to ski), steeps to ski, pow that lasts longer than one day, good french fries, and excellent draft beer. I'm not worried about shinny handles, glitzy chairs or the carpeting (although I didn't see any that was frayed). I'm looking for good snow and a safe environment for my kids. And yes, safe can be knowing they're on the Ridge with a beacon and a pack! Why? Because they're surrounded by beacons (more than I've seen at any resort), experience, volunteers, and just simply... a ton genuinely nice people.\n\nMy thanx to everyone on mountain. You're wonderfully professional and fun. Special thanx to Emily and Wanda in Group. You set us up. See everyone later this Spring and again next year with a bigger group!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-12,4,Our family enjoyed their day at Bridger Bowl. The price was very good and no crowds. The lodge was comfortable and tables to eat our packed lunch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-13,4,My son is considering Montana State University for college. Having this amazing ski area within 30 minutes from Bozeman is quite enticing. MSU students often have mid-week passes with free transportation and few crowds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-18,1,"My friend was visiting from Germany. I wanted to show her around Montana. She has never skied before. I went to college at MSU, and recall great experiences and $30 lift ticket prices.\n\nI was excited to give her a great Montana experience. We arrived for half day skiing, purchased our tickets, and got geared up. When we got to the lift line, the power went out and all skiing was closed. Although it is not likely that the power outage was their fault, their subsequent behavior was appalling. I asked for a refund of the ticket as we were completely unable to use the tickets at all. The ticket office people were rude and condescending when approaching them about a refund. I called the office a couple days later to ask if we could return to attempt another visit using our already purchased tickets. Again, the ticket office staff were rude and condescending. Basically elitist pricks. They made it sound like I didn‚Äôt belong in Bozeman where everyone apparently has excessive amounts of money to throw around. They made it sound like it was my fault for their power outage. The person on the phone stated that it was my fault ‚Äúfor not arriving earlier in the day‚Äù. Unfortunately our itinerary only allowed for a late half day visit. \n\nNot only have they refused to honor our unused tickets but they made themselves sound like rootless cosmopolitans who are too elitist for your average Montanan. \n\nI recommend avoiding this place. Bridger operates on public land leased to them but they don‚Äôt act like they respect their privilege to do so.\n\nSave your money and invest in randonee gear and explore the mountains on your own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-18,4,"When we drove to Bridger from our home in Helena recently, the good experience began in the parking lot. There's a special, close-in, lot reserved for handicap folks and anyone who caarpools (minimum three occupants per vehicle). Excellent! We also saw a city of Bozeman bus taking people to the ski hill. \n\nThe two main lodges are really well designed and maintained. Nice, but not overstated or glitzy. Very clean. \n\nRental shop opened early (!) and the rental experience was very smooth, professional,helpful and efficient. The snowboard, boots and helmet our son rented were new, in excellent condition and of high quality. Ticket window also opened early (!) and the salesclerk was cordial. Ticket price is higher than at our local ski hill back in Helena (Great Divide), but frankly it was worth it. Of course, the $63 lift ticket price at Bridger is far less than the absolutely crazy $154 we would have paid at Big Sky (otherwise known as Big Wallet). \n\nEvery Bridger employee we encountered was courteous and professional. The vibe everywhere was down to earth, pleasant and upbeat. At no time did we encounter rude or pushy people. \n\nThe lifts were good. One odd thing, however. On at least two lifts, they use a weird kind of ""magic carpet"" to move you up to where you get on the chair. We didn't like it, but it wasn't a big deal. But otherwise, the lifts moved along quickly and the lifties were great (they'd call out to us ""What's your favorite Christmas movie?""). \n\nRuns were superb. The green runs were gentle, but varied, and provided relaxed cruising. Blue runs were great fun: challenging enough, but not overdone. Other family members raved about black diamond and double black runs. Grooming was excellent. The variety of skiing/snowboarding terrain was superb. Views (of the Crazy, Gallatin, Bridger and Absaroka ranges) were world-class. Even on a Saturday during Christmas Break, we never experienced crowding on the runs, or long lines at the lifts. Wow. \n\nNever saw a ski patroller on the runs. But then again, had no problems with other skiers/riders, and saw no accidents. \n\nOn the particular day we were there, the afternoon experienced some very high winds. So watch the weather forecast and realize that (at times) high winds can be an issue.\n\nIf I ran Bridger, I would add more signs on the runs. At times, we had to stop and refer to our map to figure out where we were. \n\nWe ate in the cafeteria in the upper lodge. Wish that some people didn't leave their bags lying around. But otherwise, it was a pleasant eating space. Food was better than most ski area cafeterias and somewhat less greasy and fatty (my wife had minnestrone soup and bread) and not as expensive as typical ski area food. \n\nWhen we packed up and left for the day, we all had smiles on our faces. We'll be back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-18,3,"Went in 1999 and they improved a lot. More things for skiing. New place for beginners separate from the experience skiers. You can bring your dogs, too. Have snow making machines. Ready anytime in winter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-18,3,"We had the mountain to ourselves on a recent COLD February morning. While the lodge leaves you feeling that it is lacking, the skiing is top notch!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-18,2,Even though the tickets are affordable the crowds have really increased and the kids ski very fast and out of controll\nThere isn't much supervision controlling speed and drinking on the mountain by the skipatrol or the mountain staff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Nov-17,3,"For those of whom don't ski they may sit inside, enjoy hot coffee, cocoa and gaze out the huge windows to watch the beauty of dancing slopes of the Bridger Mt's. There are also low-cost lessons for all levels w/ lockers to place all items. It's good to arrive early so you may find a free place to park or take the free shuttle to the slopes. For skiers think cold w/ proper layers of clothing. If one loses their hat, gloves they have lost &amp; found. Enjoy all w/ camera. Great 1st aid station.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-18,4,"We just moved to Bozeman this year. My boys took ski lessons here &amp; we (parents) skied here this winter. Great skiing/snow, usually the lines are not bad at all. Reasonably priced &amp; short distance to get there (from Bozeman). Only a couple ""negative"" things: some Saturdays the road up to Bridger is ridiculous! It took us 1.5 hours to get like 10 miles b/c there were so many cars going up there &amp; some were NOT winter ready, so going off the road, spinning out, etc. It was a mess! The MSU students all go here &amp; again, that makes it a bit more crowded on weekends on the road, not to mention sometimes a little ""rowdy"" on the slopes w/ college kids (drinking, being a bit ""wild"" etc.). Honestly, not a big deal, but my boys commented on that aspect at least a couple times. Otherwise, great place to ski! Lots of terrain &amp; plenty of different levels of runs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr-18,5,Spent 2 days skiing at Bridger Bowl with 11 and 13 year old kids. Great time. Wasn‚Äôt busy at all so no lines at the lifts. Plenty of snow - conditions were great. Very affordable lift and rental prices made for an enjoyable couple days. We‚Äôll be back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-17,4,"I like Bridger, it is the low key and less expensive alternative to the resorts at Big Sky. There were no waits for the lifts, and the ski school was great for my 8 year old niece. We are so glad we chose to ski at Bridger over Big Sky. Bridger is a better option for families and new skiers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-18,4,We are seasoned Big Sky skiers but in recent years have found the prices there to be astronomical and just out of our budget for a family. For 4 people to ski there with 2 kids it costs over $400. Bridger is a GREAT ski area with lots of varied terrain for beginners and experts alike. Every lift is a carpet loader system which is really helpful for beginners. For this level of area I would expect higher rates so this is a rocking deal. $22 for my kids to ski is just so amazing. It's 20ish minutes from town too. Just a note though on busy days get there EARLY or you will be huffing it uphill for a while. There is no shuttle service from the parking lots so once the lots fill up that's it. There is a shuttle from town that I would recommend. It drops you off at the lodge so no walking or worrying about if you're going to get a parking spot. The lodges are really very nice - we usually eat at the mid-mtn one - newly built and a lot of options for food. We love sitting out on the deck if the weather allows and people watching. You really don't want to miss this ski area. Thank you Bridger for keeping your area affordable for the masses. We will be back many times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-17,5,Bridger Bowl while a local hill is a great place to ski with varied terrain including some very challenging skiing that is accessible by hiking the ride.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-17,4,No cell tower!!! Streamline bus runs shuttle or hitch hike.Locals and college types love this place. I do not ski.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-17,4,Been there many times. It has runs from beginner to expert. It is huge and a lot of fun. Can't go wrong here. It's an easy drive from Bozeman and only two hours from Billings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-17,4,"You cannot beat this place for value, 1/2 the price of Big Sky and zero pretentiousness, a great family area and close to town.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-17,5,"This is a mountain for every skier. The lower areas are very open and gentle for beginners, middle for intermediates, and all the way to the top of the ridge for true experts. Multiple lifts around open up area so you can ski lots of different runs and levels of terrain. The lodges are all really new and comfortable, fast, easy loading chairs. You load onto the chairs on a magic carpet conveyer belt. Close to Bozeman, 16 miles, so easy trip back when done. A shuttle bus runs from town for free too, so no need to park and carry gear. Tickets are reasonably priced, can book a package through the website and save on the room and tickets and discounted food tickets. They really make it easy and worthwhile to go. Will go back for more!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-17,3,"We had spring skiing conditions and a need for some WAX. No crowds, friendly atmo. Potential for some epic powder skiing above the in area lifts - need avy gear. Price is right, compared to Big Sky",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-17,3,My first visit to Bridger Bowl yielded a fantastic Spring Day. I enjoyed the terrain. Next time I'll be prepared to hike the Ridge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-17,4,"First time mountain skiing and this location was wonderful. I took advantage of the group lessons (took 3), and two of the days ended up being private lessons because I was the only one in the group. The instructors are amazing, helpful, and fun. The hills have a lot of good variety for all levels, and it isn't so busy that you feel like you will never get on the lift. The people that work there are amazing, and so fun and happy everyday. They sing and dance at the lift, and make you feel like they want to be there. Definitely recommend this ski area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-17,5,Local here in Montana and Bridger is by far the best resort in the area! Lots of runs for all levels! Had a blast coming here with my family. Definitely a must for both locals and tourists!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-17,3,"We are coming every year here for our family week long ski trip. This is not a huge resort, but there are enough trails for a week, with various levels. The prices are very reasonable, which is important for a family of 4 adults! We rent our skis from the lodge, book our hotel with the reservation center, and all the staff is extremely nice and friendly. Thanks Travis for always helping us! We love Bridger and will come back every year until we can ski for free at 80, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-17,4,I really like this ski resort. Prices are reasonable compared to the size of the mountain they are offering. they have plenty of green and blue routes to offer. it appears to me that the split of routes between green blue and black diamond are equally distributed. I would certainly recommend to any winter sport lovers to come and spend a week here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-17,5,This place rocks. I wish all the out of staters would stay in Big Sky as this needs to stay small and locals only!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-17,5,Love this place! The snow is great and so is the location. I love being able to drive from Bozeman!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-17,5,"Bridger received so much snow! Great place to ski ~ Several places to take a break, and get a beer or hot chocolate. Wait times are short!! Just go!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-17,4,"This is a non-profit ski resort!! The skiing is as good as any mountain that I have skied in MT, CO, UT, NV or CA, and at less than half of cost of most. You can afford to bring the whole family. All of the proceeds go back into expansion and improvements. Are yup looking for extreme? The Ridge and Schlushman's are exceptional. If you want challenging blacks, Bridger has them. Do you prefer the groomers or training terrain? There is that in abundance too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-17,3,"Travelled with my daughter on a spring break trip. Snow and terrain were awesome. We have been coming here for years as a family, best ski area for the money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-17,3,"The ski area is getting to be much more crowded than it used to be, but is still my top choice in the Bozeman/Big Sky area for a weekday ski. There is a lunch cafeteria at the base and also one on the mountain by the bridger lift with some homemade food options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-17,4,"We were impressed with this resort, not only were the rates affordable, but a ton of terrain to choose from!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-17,4,"Where I come from... we measure 26 in centimeters... not inches... 26 cm at Revelstoke means get in line at like 6:00 AM. What do you do when it snows 26"" overnight? I still don't know how to comprehend that day....\n\nShout out to Ski patrol who somehow got the whole mountain open at some point in the day. Like.... WOW. AMAZING. \n\nShout out to the locals who were super friendly and in amazing spirits. No one was stealing lines and people were happy to show a fellow powder hound a good time. \n\nShout out to all the lifties and ticket attendants who made the obscene lift lines not matter that much.\n\nKnow this Bridger Bowl... I will be back as I want to test out that crazy looking ridge terrain on a regular old day. I was lucky to get an OBSCENE powder day (the BBC as the locals informed me...) and it was a blast. Your terrain is amazing and up there with the likes of Jackson, Whistler, Snowbird, and my little hometown mountain Revelstoke!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-17,3,"Bridger Bowl is a wonderful local ski area with reasonable rates for skiing and very competent people working in all phases of resort operation. The ski patrol is first class. The snow can be a little variable from year to year, but when it's good it's really good. Unfortunately, it has become too popular so weekends can be a total zoo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-17,3,Bridger Bowl is a great local ski area. It is not crowded on the week days unless it's a holiday. Great runs for all levels of skiing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-17,3,"Just 20 minutes from beautiful Bozeman, Montana, Bridger is the perfect area to take the family to ski! No long lines, great instructors, amazing conditions. You cannot beat Bridger for best Return on Vacation Investment!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-17,4,I've been here already two seasons. So one thing that I love about Bridgers is not so many people on regular days. One thing I don't like are slow lifts. Food in all lodges is great. So overall it is nice ski resort. And it doesn't matter if you're skiing alone or with family. Thumbs up Bridgers! \nP.S: but those lifts though...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-17,5,"This is a truly special ski area. Bridger Bowl is where little kids from Bozeman learn to ski really well, it is a rite of passage for most. A great first time ski vacation for a middle class family. Not a huge dog and pony show full of pomp and jackasses who have flown in from LA with all the best gear they will never use again and an Escalade they can't get into 4 wheel drive. Only a 20 minute drive to a great downtown with excellent restaurants. A family mountain with great ski terrain and local friendlies that will help you get you, your roommates and dependents organized for an epic skiing adventure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-17,5,"You cannot beat the ticket prices for this place! $57/lift ticket (non-holiday) Skiing is great. Would love to see more blue runs but I think they were limited partly because we went while early ski conditions existed (not as much snow yet). Customer Service is what gave this place my Excellent Rating. They are fantastic! Felt like friends by the time we were done, especially James in the ski shop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-17,4,"Came back to Bridger Bowl after going to other Montana places for the last 6 years. The upgrades to the north side of the mountain with the 2 lifts and the new lodge was very nice. Free wifi at the alpine lodge was a nice surprise after finding out there is no cell service once you leave Bozeman. Was there during the nfl playoffs so wanted to watch some of the games and needed wifi as there are no tvs that I could find on the mountain. The lines were small, no wait was more than 3 minutes and the loading carpet helped but every lift stopped at least once when riding so guessing there was falling on the unload. Glad I went back, really like it here and will come back again soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-16,5,"This ski area is by far one of the best around. It is not nearly as big as Big Sky but this is the place that all the locals hang out. Lift tickets are cheap and usually they are always 100% open all winter. Very impressed with how the ski area invests back into the mountain, in the last couple years they have upgraded numerous lifts and eating areas. That to me is one of the greatest things a ski area can do, the nicer the lifts are the shorter the lines and I can ski more and be less stressed!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,5,"Our large group has rented a condo close to Bridger Bowl a few years in a row now, and we love the place more every time we come back. Great skiing at affordable prices, and something for all levels of expertise. Get a tour of Bridger Bowl on your first day; it's a great way to learn the mountain, runs and lifts by someone that knows them well! (And remember to tip- these are usually volunteers on the mountain doing this). I appreciate the 2 bathrooms/ cafeterias located away from the lodge- you are never too far from food, or a restroom, should you need it. If you get lucky, you'll get some Blue Smoke powder- one of my best days on a mountain, ever!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-17,5,We came to Bozeman to ski Big Sky and after a cold and expensive day there decided to give Bridger Bowl a try. What a little gem this is and we would consider going back. Living where we do we have amazing ski resorts in our backyard but this hill really surprised us. A great family feel to it and very little wait times for the lifts. Plus the lift tickets are half as much as Big Sky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-17,5,"It's everything you need in a ski resort, without the high prices or the long with lines. They have the double black diamond runs, or they have the basic greens. It's excellent family skiing, and rarely do you see a lift line. And the best part, lift tickets are half the price of other local big resorts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Aug-14,4,Climbed a mountain! Summer 2013. A beautiful and great experience. Walking through snow in late July in our sneakers and shorts at 90 something degrees. What a view at the top of Sacajawea!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-14,4,"This is a wonderful ski resort-low key and family oriented- that also has great powder skiing especially if you take time to hike the ridge. If not-lovely groomed hills, nice places to stop and eat, good parking without a long walk with skis. Never a wait in line to get on the lifts!! Good people-great experience. And rentals are at a great price!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-15,4,"Not much better skiing than at Bridger Bowl. For locals such as myself it is affordable and fun for a day trip. Great snow and grooming where needed. Now don't show this review to anyone, it keeps the crowds away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jun-15,5,Not overpriced and fun place to ski. Good BEER and good old Montana ladies. Nice lodge and and love the midway lodge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jun-15,5,"Great place, lots of friendly locals. Nice staff and great service. Would ski here over Big Sky any day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-14,4,"Great for a smaller, local ski hill. I prefer Big Sky, but you'll have to shell out a few more to ski there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-15,4,"Before moving to Montana, I didn't know ski resorts like this existed. Less than 30 minutes from downtown Bozeman, no lines for lifts (ok, sometimes on the busiest of days I have to wait 5 minutes or so), $55 lift tickets, great lessons, rentals and snow conditions. There is skiing for all levels including a bunny slope for beginners and the Ridge which requires an avalanche transceiver. Enjoy great food and sometimes live music, but always drinks after a day skiing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-15,3,"Bridger is a great mountain that is only about a 15-20 minute drive from downtown Bozeman. Most people probably visit Bozeman from out of state to ski nearby Big Sky Resort, but that's fine with us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr-15,3,"Bridger Bowl is only 16 miles from Bozeman making it a playground for winter sports enthusiasts in the area. Excellent expert terrain, less expensive than many ski areas, inexpensive season passes, all lifts have moving carpets for smooth loading. Been skiing/snowboarding there for nearly 30 years now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-15,4,"Because of Bridger's 2700 ft of vertical, 350+ inches of snow, 2,000 skiable acres and 75 named trails, Bridger is comparable to some of world's best ski resorts. However, due to its renegade nonprofit status and lack of stockholders, Bridger Bowl has been able to eschew typical resort sprawl and reinvest year-end profits back into the mountain for the past half century. The result? Heavenly skiing without the lift lines. One note of caution, there is sometimes a lack of seating in the lodges due to the popularity of Bridger's fries and generous pours of Montucky. Additionally, there are certain areas of the mountain that require an avalanche transceiver to ski - just don't complain about it like the guy in the local favorite YouTube video ""Bridger Bowl Rant"" did, or you will wind up as the opener for all future ski movie premiers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-16,3,Our first time to Bridger and really enjoyed it. Affordable skiing and a nice variety of terrain. Blessed with fresh snow so had lots of powder to play in but also nice groomers. Staff is friendly too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,4,We had an excellent time enjoying the good snow conditions and friendly staff. No lift lines. One day we were greated by a host who was offering to go up with us to show us the mountain and the runs. We much prefer to ski Bridger than any Colorado resort. We would highly recommend Bridger for all levels of skiing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,5,"Make Bridger a must if you are planning to ski in Montana. Great prices, great snow, and nice chalets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,4,"Having skied much of CO, some Cali, a lot of UT. . . . it was time to experience MT. In the Bozeman area (near) there are 2 spots and the small (non-resort) one is Bridger. We found this little ski area very accommodating with very nice folks. Ticket prices were about 1/2 of the major ""resort"" in the area and it was very convenient of a ""somewhat"" beginner and an experienced skier. It was easy to have a bite and relax and get back to the great runs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,3,"Fantastic fun for the family! Great runs, friendly and low key, totally uncommercial and anti-resort in nature, with a price point to match.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,3,"Bridger is my favorite place to ski and mostly that is because of the people that work here. Don't get me wrong, the slopes are great. My kids are 8 and 10 and they can go up virtually any chairlift and find their way down without getting into trouble. There is truly something for every level of skier. The ski school is fantastic. We generally get our kids a 90 minute private lesson because we only get out a couple times each year and we have never been disappointed. Patrick is our favorite instructor and my 10 year old daughter requests him every year. There are 4 lodges that serve food and the prices are reasonable and the food is good. The people working on the mountain, whether they are serving food or running the chair lift are fantastic. They are smiling and happy and always have kind words. I have no idea why anyone would spend twice as much to go to Big Sky when Bridger Bowl has so much to offer. It is a short drive from Bozeman which has lots of choices for lodging and food.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,4,"Enjoyed a day skiing here, even with the warm temperatures snow was pretty good. Price was $54 for lift ticket half of Big Sky. Good variety of terrain. Grooming was not as good as Big Sky but with half the price to sky here it was ok. Able to park pretty close to lifts, good bar and restaurant areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-16,3,"Good terrain, but slower lifts. Still short lines compared to bigger resorts. Be sure to get some of the famous fries at the mid-mountain lodge. But be forewarned, the serving is not for a single person-- definitely need to share!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-16,4,"Bridger is a great hill! \n\nAffordable prices for a ski area ($54 for adult/$19 for children) &amp; not much waiting at the lift lines. Plenty of varied terrain for all skill levels. \n\nThe other great thing about Bridger is they are a non-profit &amp; not run like a typical ""resort."" There is more information on their website about their ""sustainability mission"" and information on carpooling &amp; the weekend shuttle system. \n\nThe cafeteria style food isn't anything too special, so if you want a healthier (or vegetarian) option, you might consider bringing a lunch. \n\nVery convenient/short drive from Bozeman/Belgrade area. \n\nOverall, we would love to ski there again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,4,"Great local hill, been there before and got to cash in on my free lift ticket thru the Powder Alliance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-15,3,"We had a great ski experience at Bridger! The benefits of skiing here outweighed driving to Big Sky \n\nPros: Very economical - young kids free if only asking on bottom of mountain, 20-30 minute drive from Bozeman, easy parking, rental, lift tix, children class sign up, ski school was helpful for our 6 year old and ended up being solo in group class, not crowded, very short lift lines, good slopes, modern lifts.\n\nCons: not as extensive or large as some competitors..., more limited terrain park, some longer flat areas down low.\n\nNeutral: Culinary/ bar options are fine but less extensive than larger competitors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-15,4,With less than 1 week left before they close for the season all the lifts were open and all the caf√©s. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Never lines on the lifts and we almost had the mountain to ourselves. We have 10 &amp; 12 year olds and this mountain is perfect for them as well as my husband ( very good skier) and myself ( I stick to blues and short blacks). The trails were groomed both mornings we went. And the price of lift tickets is great; $18 for kids!! If you're looking for a great ski mountain that is a favorite with locals and not pretentious then this is the place. We try to come here every spring. It's only 30 minutes from bozeman.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-15,4,Bridger Bowl is about a half hour from central Bozeman on paved roads. It is a pleasant medium-sized facility with newer structures and services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-15,5,"We had been to Big Sky at the beginning of our trip and found ourselves with extra time and a desire to ski again, so we checked out Bridger Bowl. We told the staff that the kids had had their first lesson earlier in the week and the kids were placed in lessons based on that information. It turned out that our youngest child was in a lesson that was not at the level where he was. The instructor took the initiative to move him to a class that was better suited to his experience and needs. (Huge praise for taking initiative!) After the class, all 3 of my kids raved about their lesson experience and teachers. My husband had planned to take them skiing the rest of the afternoon but sprained his thumb so he was done for the day. We went back to the office to see about having someone take our kids on some green runs for an hour since we weren't ready to turn them loose (and they weren't ready!) The office staff was very helpful, flexible, and able to accommodate our request. When the kids returned they gushed about their great experience. The guide told me she thought they were ready to ski on their own. Off they went on a few runs until it was time to go! It was a fun and successful day for all! Only drawback: the runs were a bit icy which made me very nervous (I'm not a good skier), but I don't hold that against the the people! Tidbit I learned: A staff person told me that wifi is being installed this summer and should be available next winter. There was no cell service while I was there. I hope we can visit again soon!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-15,3,"Even though I fell and thought my collar bone was broken, I still had fun. The staff really helped out when I fell and got me down the mountain and to the aid station quick. Before my incident, I was having a ton of fun and was blown away by how beautiful it was and how great the powder was!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-15,5,"OK, the snow was marginal but this year having any snow is great. The price is right, only $53. The locals are friendly and quirky and good skiers; you have to be because the inbounds terrain is steep, with interesting terrain features and multiple aspects. Any chairlift that has an avy transceiver checkpoint before you can load has to be access the goods, and it does. And then there is the side country...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-15,5,"We came from Big Sky to stay a few days in Bozeman and tried out Bridger Bowl. What a treasure - a short and pretty drive to the slopes, no crowds, price is right and great skiing. Wish we lived here and could take advantage of Bridger Bowl more often!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-15,5,"This is a great place to go skiing with challenging terrain, friendly staff and high speed lifts all for a reasonable price! The bowls are fun, the groomers are varied in difficulty and an overall great place to go skiing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-15,5,"I visited Bridger Bowl with my daughter and grandchildren on Saturday, Feb. 21, 2015. After quite a few days without fresh snow, a recent overnight snow had produced new powder. As a result when I arrived I was horrified by the crowded parking lot. However, those fears were soon vanished. Parking attendants were efficiently directing folks into the lots. Once we got to the Sunnyside lift to gain access to the upper mountain, we only had to wait 9 minutes. Then once on top we had access to Alpine Way, Powder Park, Pierre's Knob lifts and never had another wait in line. I was amazed that on a very, very busy day for Bridger Bowl, how the mountain was easily able to absorb so many skiers. \n\nOur skiing experience was simply fabulous, as we spent the day skiing all over the mountain and taking almost all of the lifts, except the Slachman's lift, which requires avalanche beacons, etc. For lunch we decided to try the new Alpine cabin. What a great view of the mountain while enjoying a great lunch of brats, made from fresh local products. The previous week I had skied at BB and had chile at the Deer Creek Lodge. The BB chile is absolutely the best! (unlike the miserable stuff they now serve down at the Madison Lodge at Moonlight).\n\nThe employees in the food service and lift attendants were very friendly and helpful. And here's the thing about Bridger Bowl---what a FABULOUS VALUE!!! Now that Big Sky has gone big time and charges exorbitant prices, at least compared to what they USED to charge when you had the stand alone Moonlight Basin, Bridger Bowl is SO affordable, with great rates for kids, seniors, and they provide means for buying very economical lift tickets if you don't want to buy a season pass. One such example is the deal where if you purchase a set of ten lift tickets (all day) the price comes out to only $40 per ticket. What a deal considering the great skiing!\n\nOne more thing about BB--that mountain seems to really collect and hold the snow. I skied here a few weeks ago during a time when there had not been any fresh snow for a couple of weeks, and was surprised at how good the conditions were. No rocks, no gravel. Nothing like the conditions you frequently encounter as you ski off the SIx Shooter lift, and ESPECIALLY the Lone Tree lift at Moonlight with the rocks and gravel all over the place. I guess the wind funnels through those spots and does not allow the snow to collect. I still have dents and scratches from an earlier ski at Moonlight. No such problem at Bridger Bowl. \n\nFor this local, I doubt that I will ever return to Big Sky or Moonlight with their current pricing. Why should I when we have such great conditions, runs, food service and GREAT VALUE at Bridger Bowl!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-15,3,"Amazing mountain. Really good terrain for everyone, from beginner flats on the bottom half to the crazy stuff off the schlasman chair. What really made me fall in love with this place and Bozeman in general though is the people. Everyone is super friendly and doesn't hesitate to point you towards the goods.\n\nCan't wait to go back :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-18,4,"We normally ski Big Sky but wanted to try Bridger. We will never return. The mountain doesn‚Äôt offer many runs or lifts, and the lines were very long on a Sunday afternoon. We had to use a tow rope (yes, the kind I used 40 years ago when I learned to ski) to get back from one area of the hill to the lift. It‚Äôs not easy. At 3:30- they close at 4:00- we wanted to stop for a beer. Alas, the restaurant was closed and no drinks were being sold any longer. No joke. Also, when we arrived for the day, we wanted to buy half day tickets and be ready to ski at the lift at 12:30. But they won‚Äôt sell the tickets early. So we all had to stand around at the ticket counters and wait in lines rather than them letting us buy the tickets early. There were about 20 people wanting to buy tickets. To make it even more humiliating, they blast the squeaking from a plastic toy chicken into their microphone when it was 12:30-ostensibly to let us know that now they would be so kind as to sell all of us tickets. It‚Äôs a nonsensical approach to wait until 12:30 and also to treat your customers so poorly. Don‚Äôt ski Bridger. Go to Big Sky where the skiing is always amazing, more runs than you can ski in a day, and the employees treat customers well. We will never return to Bridger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-18,3,"We experienced one of the greatest snow days on our recent vaction. The lodge is very comfortable, the food was exellent and the sking was fantastic. We were there midweek and there was little to no waiting on the lifts. There are many diverse runs and excellent lifts. Looking forward to going there again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-18,3,"I was told Bridger Bowl was a good mountain to ski, so I checked it out. It was pleasant. I went in the week, so it wasn't busy. There were no lines to the chairlift. I got quite a few runs in. There are some challenging trails there. It is a moderate sized mountain and not small by any means. The price of a lift ticket for the day is definitely worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-18,4,"Smartly run local ski area with lots of vertical and terrain variety from family friendly to extreme. Lodges are very clean, well-designed and inviting. Definitely, a must if you are a skier and find yourself in Bozeman.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-18,4,"We have skied Bridger Mt. several times over the years and really lucked out on the snow this time! One day there was 19"" of fresh light (4-5% moisture) snow which was WONDERFUL to ski through--way less work that heavier powder we thought was good at home. As far as we could tell, there is almost no cell service there and in the canyon road area, at least with Verizon. We had spotty ""live"" spots, especially at the top of the higher lifts. The lowest lodge had useless wi-fi, but the Jim Bridger lodge had OK wi-fi. (Don't know about the other lodges). The weekend crowd made it almost impossible to get a table in the eating areas, but Monday was no problem, even at 12:30. Two days the wind was gusting so strong during the night and morning we hesitated to drive up from our rented house halfway from Bozeman (not a bad drive) but it abated on the mountain and we had good skiing. They have plenty of snow for good coverage, too. We took advantage of the Ski Alliance agreement with our home area season-pass so only had to buy Saturday tickets for our 4-days of skiing! It's just 20 miles or so from downtown Bozeman which has a fun quaint downtown, lots of hotels, restaurants, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Sep-17,5,Great snow in the winter and beautiful hikes in the summer. you can't beat the views and experience at Bridger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-18,4,"Bridger Bowl is easy driving distance from Bozeman hotels at I-90 and 7th Street. The road is not difficult, even if it's snowing. The parking is free but does not have a parking lot shuttle. The food is much less expensive than at the other resort outside of Bozeman. Also the lift tickets are only $60.00 for the day, verses $140 down at Big Sky. The lifts have conveyors to assist loading, but are not high speed. Terrain is a little short on beginner runs, but lot's of options for experienced and expert skiers. This was my 2nd visit and I would certainly return for the good skiing and great value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-18,3,"Loved skiing Bridger Bowl! Lots of easy trails but once you get above them, there‚Äôs lots of fun variety. Alpine lift gets you up into some gorgeous runs that smell like Christmas trees. Pierre‚Äôs Knob has some pretty fast/steep runs. The lodges are clean &amp; well-maintained; food is perfectly reasonable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-18,5,"My wife and I are true ski bums...both retired and ski over 100 days each year throughout North America. In fact have skied about 40 of the top 50 resorts. We found Bridger to be a delightful ski experience and thoroughly enjoyed the day!! It has a beautiful setting, first rate infrastructure and fun terrain. Would certainly recommend this mountain. The only slight issue is the variety of terrain. Some of that was attributable to early season conditions which limited some of the expert areas. Overall this is a wonderful ski experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-17,5,"We hit Bridger Bowl on the first Monday it opened this season and really enjoyed our time there. It was our first visit and we loved how it did not feel like a big commercial ski resort and had more of that friendly, local vibe. Prices were very reasonable and the facilities were great. We knew being early in the season the base wasn't the best, but we still had a lot of fun and enjoyed the beautiful surroundings. We are looking forward to returning sometime in the near future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-15,4,Decent skiing just outside Bozeman with reasonable lift rates. Food is low standard cafeteria fare. Free parking. Can't compare to world class skiing at Big Sky about an hour south of Bozeman.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-15,5,"It is real. It has incredible terrain for black diamond skiers as well as plenty of groomers. People are considerate. It is the antithesis to the dress-to-the-nines places. If you want a true ski experience, this is for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr-15,5,Bridger Bowl is an affordable place for skiers and families. We took our young grandchildren for introductory skiing lessons. The instructors were fabulous. The kids were able to show considerable progress within 3 lessons. It was very affordable. Accessible from Bozeman.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-15,5,"This is a great community ski area. The kids programs made my kids into crazy expert skiers. The ""ski PE"" program is fabulous for MSU students at all levels. It is not a great destination resort: no on-hill lodging, iffy dining, no high speed lifts, but it is a great hill for a small price. The advanced terrain is world class - nice intermediate and beginner terrain but with slow lifts it is nothing special. It is however relatively inexpensive. I have had a season pass there for 28 seasons and I love it, but I live here and the convenience rules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-15,4,"We've been skiing Bridger Bowl for 15 years, since the kids were in backpacks. Now we ski all the terrain with them. It's a big playground, not as many acres as Big Sky but has numerous little tree areas that really are fun. Hiking the Ridge is amazing, the beauty and feeling of being on top of the mountains is well worth the price of admission.\nAlso hiking in the summer is really fun and beautiful too, especially if you time it right and see the wild flowers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jun-15,3,"If you want to ski or just get in touch with nature then this is the place for you. If, like me, you have hard, icy snow in your country then Brider Bowl has lots of soft, fluffy snow. There are easy, hard and bumpy runs, each with a spectacular view from the top. You must ski the bowl some time. In summer, an equally nice place to visit. The drive up to Bridger is part of the fun going under stone arches and passing rivers and ranches on the way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr-15,4,"It's a relatively small mountain, but it has some very intense steeps, especially off the top. When there is plenty of snow, and if you are willing to do some walking/climbing, there are dozens if not hundreds of lines between the trees and rocks that range from wicked to hair-raising.\nThe terrain down below is a lot more tame.\nThis is a bit of an old-school resort in that it doesn't have a lot of new, fancy equipment and the window-dressings of more affluent resorts.\nSome lifts require you to have your avalanche beacon and shovel. They check every time, so be prepared.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-15,4,"Awesome ski area, still affordable. Not too many bells or whistles, just the things you need. If you want access to the entire ski area bring your avalanche beacon and be prepared to do some hiking. If you know what you are doing, head for the ridge. If not, and you just wanna have some fun, head for hully gully.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-14,4,Bozeman had the best skiing in the world. There are no lines and there is enough hill to occupy all levels. The food and beer is great...best place to teach a child...low priced and excellent lessons! Taught my kids here at age three...The instructors taught me as well as the kids so I could continue to developing skiers after the lessons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-14,4,"wonderful local ski hill, with a down home feel. Great terrain and way better snow than Big Sky. fun!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trails for all levels well maintained. Locals on the mountain super friendly and helpful. A gem!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-16,5,"Bridger Bowl is the only non-profit ski area in the US and prides itself on being a family focused hill. We ski there most weekends and enjoy the safe, family-friendly vibe along with pristine powder for all ability levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-16,4,"Love Bridger Bowl. It is how I remember skiing when I was young. Casual, not over crowded, friendly staff, affordable ticket prices. It also is so close, that it is perfect for a couple hours of skiing without committing an entire day. I do wish there was more intermediate terrain. You are limited to the lower 2/3 of the mountain unless you are an expert skier and want to ski off the ridge line. Most born and raised Bozemanites are expert skiers having grown up on this mountain. But the rest of us...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-16,4,"As a Bozeman resident, I prefer to ski here vs. Big Sky. I love the small town feel and locals only vibe but it's not a mean locals only vibe. If you fall, someone almost always stops and asks if you are ok or need help. Just a great place to take your kids skiing and to enjoy Montana skiing without all the movie star hubbub of Big Sky. Oh and great ski runs too. ;)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jun-16,4,"I love Bridger. I learn how to ski there 14 years ago\nFriendly people, a always willing to help. Very affordable!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Nov-15,3,We bought a season pass and loved that we could go up easily on any week day and park a short walk from the ski slopes. I had an accident on the last day of the season and they took great care of me too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,4,"After 20 years of visiting Bridger Bowl I have never had a bad experience! Great staff, great prices, great skiing, great food! The atmosphere is so refreshing and comfortable. Someday I hope to bring my children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-15,5,"We got midweek passes this year and cold not be happier. It is only 20 minutes from downtown bozeman when the roads are clear. there are no lines on the week days, parking is easy and the runs are fast and fun. the lifts are a little slow but no one cares since it is so close to home and easy to get to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-16,4,Because there is no on hill lodging it depends on locals. Food and ski chalets are plentiful. But when it snows forget it all the college students cut class and head for the slopes and the place is packed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-15,4,"My family of 4 skied Bridger Bowl over Christmas and found the hill to be really nice. We arrived and made use of the quite large 15 minute dropoff area to save the whining from the kids until later. Lift tickets were extremely reasonably priced and were a relief from nearby overpriced ski areas. Once we were on the hill, the kids had a blast. my 7 and 10 year olds easily navigated the blue runs and the lift operators were exceptionally helpful about reminding my kids what to do. We thought that the ""magic carpet-like"" lift areas were really neat and saved on botched loads. A great improvement to the hill! Our only complaint was the weather which certainly isn't anything that can be controlled. It was a very windy day which meant frequent trips indoors. The hot chocolate was good, meals were reasonably priced and bathrooms were clean. All in all a great day!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-16,4,"We were attracted to Bridger for its impressive track record on sustainability and environmental friendliness. The prices are reasonable because Bridger is a co-op, and do not reflect in any way a lower quality slope. Fantastic variety of slopes from the easiest to most extreme. Fantastic instructors! If you go to ski for food, fashion and off-slope entertainment this is not your place. Make sure to take a trail map. as the trails are not marked in great detail. There is however a nice well marked ""easiest route down"" for those who need it. An excellent experience for very young children, (pre-K).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-15,5,"Nice ski area w/plenty of varied terrain. Holds snow pretty good after a dump, Has everything from super easy to super hard. Cold. Uphill from parking, Decent prices on beer/drinks/some food Friendly staff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-15,4,"I thought this was going to be a podunk backyard little ski area, it turned out to be an excellent area to visit, it had that small town family atmosphere with the attitude to go along with it, the more ski areas I visit the more I appreciate the family attitude. The mountain is expansive and terrain vast and challenging. They received 17 inches of fine powder the two days we skied there so there was plenty of POW to go around. I was disappointed that I was not able to ride the Schlasman lift, my Son did not want to ride it and I did not feel comfortable going alone as avalanche transceivers (457 khz) are required - Bridger should find a way to get at least one run open on the Schlasman lift where a avalanche transceiver (457 khz) is not required, although after seeing the Ridge Terrain, I totally understand their position.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-15,3,"Can't beat the price for kids, only $19. Decent variety of runs. .. Doesn't have some of the amenities of larger ski resorts. ..ie: some of the lifts seemed dated and slow, not many foot rests, runs not well labeled... However the snow was fantastic, we never waited in line (and it is a holiday week), and our ski instructor seemed to like his job! Eat early on the mountain if you are going to, they close must of those 2ish..then your only option is the bar in the lodge ..oh and they have a parking lot close in for cars with more than 3 occupants, take the closer parking families! overall we enjoyed the value AND beauty of this resort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-15,3,"We loved Bridger! While it is ""smaller"" (fewer lifts, runs) than other mega-resorts, it is more than big enough to be enjoyable for all levels of skiers on a multi-day ski vacation. Lift prices (especially for kids) are unbeatable! We didn't encounter any lines/crowds and the snow was spectacular! Varied terrain - wide open spaces and trees and everything in between. We didn't cover any of the extreme terrain, but it was fun to watch from the lifts as other skiers tackled the ""scary stuff"". We will return!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-15,4,"My family hasn't ever skied before so we signed up for a family lesson - it was an hour and a half long, and reasonably priced.

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-15,3,"This is the best skiing in Montana, even the ""world famous"" Big Sky does not stand a chance against bridger bowl, this is the place to ski, with very reasonable lift prices, skiing for all skill levels, and pretty good food.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-16,4,"It's just a short drive from Bozeman and it has the best snow. This is a local favorite and once you go you will know why. Other ski areas get more hype but if you are looking for a true ski experience, this is the place. Its the real deal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,5,This is one of the original ski areas in Montana that has typically had excellent snow coverage and usually early in the ski season. It's terrain is also very family friendly and yet offers challenging slopes for those that want to push the limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-16,4,"While not exactly a ski ""resort"", Bridger Bowl offers a great ski/snowboard experience for all levels.

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-16,4,"We lucked out with a bout of cold weather and a modest snow fall on a Spring break Wednesday.\nThe bottom of the hill is pretty shallow, so there are quite a few spots that require poling or kicking to keep going.\nThe Boy goes to MSU and has a season pass. Bridger Bowl folks are really easy to work with. He's had good experience with the office folks and we were all happy with the on-site rental shop. There is another rental outfit right off the parking area that The Boy waved us away from. Don't know why. My rental skis were quite sticky and they cheerfully waxed them on request.\nAll the staff around the resort were really nice and seemed to be tickled with their jobs.\nThe on-site food options were surprisingly un-exorbitant. Typical fare.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-16,4,"Spent two afternoons here, learning to ski. Great scenery, helpful people in the rental shop. I'm told the powder early in the day was excellent. My five afternoon runs were great!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-16,4,"I wish I lived closer to this great resort! This was my fourth visit, and I love the setting, the runs (although I stick to the easier trails), and the great value with reasonable lift ticket prices. The food in the lodges isn't anything to write home about, but then, I don't go there for fine dining.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-19,4,"If you are an extreme skier, this is your place. The hike to terrain is just unreal. But of course that was way over our heads.\n\nWe are older skiers who prefer steep groomed runs. That is something lacking here. They have great intermediate runs and some very good beginner runs but nothing in between Oh my god and flat runs.\n\nThe lifts and facilities are first rate. The mid mountain restaurant is great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-19,5,Took my family skiing last weekend and it was gorgeous! Next to no one on the lower part of the hill and groomed runs with slight powder covering made for a great day to teach my kiddo how to ski!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-19,4,"No fooling around here. Plenty of snow and powder. No condos,outrageous prices,heated chairs, villages with Jewlers and furriers etc. if you are looking for a Vail,chamonix or whistler head up the road. This family oriented and BIG time steeps,bumps,woods and nice people. The ridge andSchlussmans lift are hike up areas for which you need avelanche beacons. The rest of the area none. Enough gentle terrain as well. Certified ski school. Kids programs for locals every weekend. Also town races. Ski rentals and repairs very nice people too The way it used to be. Come join the fun but I am not telling you where my powder stash is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-18,3,"The place is simply amazing, the mountains and the trails are awesome! We had a big group from beginners to advanced and everyone had a blast !

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-19,4,"Great skiing and riding located just outside Bozeman, MT. The mountain has a lot to offer with a good deal of varying terrain.

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-19,3,"A smaller ski destination however PLENTY of skiing terrain from back-country/beacon-required ridges to nicely novice; no-pretense; no-glitz; affordable (compared to Big Sky); rarely lift-lines. A community-serving non-profit. Excellent ski school and competent rescue (required, alas, when a companion concussed on hard-pack.... it's why one wears a helmet, right?). The BEST!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-19,3,"Bridger Bowl is amazing! It was runs for all levels, and lots of them, you couldn't get bored. Much more reasonable pricing than Big Sky or other more famous ski areas.

Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-18,5,"My group of 4 adults thoroughly enjoyed Bridger Bowl! Two in our group had never seen snow or been skiing before and the lessons at Bridger really helped them out! My husband and I did lessons on the green slopes with an instructor who really helped teach us some additional tricks and build our confidence on the slopes, we hadn‚Äôt been skiing for a couple years. Bridger was amazing! There are a lot of runs and there weren‚Äôt big lines or crowds for the lifts! Very affordable price for the three day pass. Hope to be back soon!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec-18,3,I typically ski in the Tahoe basin - i.e. sierra cement - and it was nice to finally experience some cold smoke!! This is a very nice resort with terrain that will please everyone! We were there over the Christmas holiday and even then we never waited more than a minute or two to get on the lift. Easy parking - and if you carpool it's even better. If you are in the area and looking to ski/snowboard this is a must!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,3,Most people are drawn to Bozeman to ski Big Sky. Take a day to ski the local hill and always check for the flashing light on the Baxter Hotel. Calling locals to great skiing. Bridger is half the cost and a great experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,5,I was in Bozeman for a week of work and took a day to get some runs in at Bridger. This is a great place for sking. It has runs and lifts for all abilities. Definitely enough to keep you busy all day. I skied the groomed slopes and there were Plenty of blue and a few blacks. \nPlus with it being half the price of Big Sky and a lot closer it was perfect if you only have one day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,5,This is a relatively small ski area about 15 miles from Bozeman. Ski lift tickets are $53 per day and there are at least two ski rental shops at the mountain. I have always visited and skied during the week and have never had a lift line! But I suspect the weekends are busy. Several restaurants on the mountain with warming houses. Great place!! Friendly staff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,5,Ski here the most out of any other ski resort and love it! I would think it would be very neat if they did night skiing. I love the lodges my favorite is the deer park chalet. Jimmy b's in Jim bridger lodge has the Best food. All the lodges have the best fries me and my friends always look forward to eating them.-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-16,3,"This area is great to use. Don't expect high speed quads but enjoy the way skiing is meant to be enjoyed. Great variety of slopes, something for everyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-16,5,"We love snowboarding in Montana. The mountains are less crowded then other states and usually much cheaper. We've been boarding for over ten years so we've been all over the US\n\nTypically we do Whitefish (love it there!) but decided to switch it up this year. Glad we did! It was a nice variety. \n\nI have zero complaints. It wasn't packed. We got lucky with awesome snow fall. Restaurants in the area were great. Locals were nice and helpful. \n\nWe decided to go here instead of Big Sky because of price and the fact we hate sharing the mountain with tourists. Even if we are one ourselves.\n\nDon't regret that decision, the mountain was more then what we needed!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-16,5,"Went here on a Sat and the place was absolutely packed. Do yourself a favor. If you're here to ski/snowboard, just spend the extra cash and time to visit Big Sky.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-16,4,"Good place for the traveller who wants to go snow skiing, but has to hire ski gear. Hire rates and lift ticket costs are much lower than other areas. Whilst I only went there once, I was pleasantly surprised with the friendliness of the other skiers. It is well patronised by the local community which leads to the community feel of the place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-16,5,"Having alpine skied all over the world I was wowed by Bridger. Not huge by those standards, but Bridger has everything to offer from fanatical steeps to easy cruisers, and the friendliest of people. Bridger is considered a college ski area but that should not deter any visitor and lift ticket prices are very reasonable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan-16,5,"A perfect day of skiing at the best""town"" ski area in America.\nFrom the new lifts to the hike and ski ridge terrain, Bridger has it all.\nA mountain tour from Ric C. An instructor in the world renown Snow Sports school, made a perfect way to acquaint us the the old Bridger that we knew from the 90's.\nWow, awesome progress that exceeded expectations.\nThe new Alpine on mountain warmup hut is really cool.\nAwesome views and great vintage pictures throughout the building, make a hot chocolate stop an adventure on its own.\nThis should be a must do for any skier who is old enough to remember ""Cubco"" bindings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-14,5,"Love the friendly atmosphere, great snow, nice layout! I'm a lifelong skier and enjoy skiing different areas around the world. Bridger is a gem. Friendly locals -- look for the singing liftop! He's dancing and having a great time. Makes the day really fun when you have an employee enjoying himself and getting everyone involved. Varied terrain. Plenty of beginner runs for learning, great hike-to chutes and steeps. I spent the day hiking and skiing chutes in 2' of snow from earlier in the week. Snow was great and we found several untracked runs to enjoy. It was fun to see the MSU math department skiing together!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Sep-14,4,"But this is a beautiful place to visit even in the off season. Leaves are changing and there was snow this week (but it melted), still this long time bowl is as popular as ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr-14,4,"Bridger Bowl is a great place to ski/snow board if you like friendly staff, good service and reasonable prices (lift tickets, food, lessons). 2013-2014 was an outstanding snow year and hopefully 2014-2015 will be too. Come and enjoy the great terrain, snow and fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jun-14,4,"Magnifent snow dotted mountains in June, tall green grass with variety of evergreen trees, creeks rushing with fresh snow melt, antelope, deer and eagles observed along the way, and a gorgeous colorful sunset late in the evening. Drive well worth taking to feel just a little bit more alive!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-14,5,"Love this local area, lots of hard terrain and fantastic snow, fewer crowds, great views. Sometimes they open late due to avalanche control and parking is awful, but it's worth it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-14,4,"It had good snow when we visited, but it reminded me of an eastern resort. It certainly was not at all like the massive, steep and deep Big Sky Resort close by.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr-14,4,"Bridger Bowl continues to offer, like everything else in Bozeman, serious, authentic, and challenging experiences and recreation without attitude. The mountain skews intermediate to advanced on terrain, but better access to beginner/intermediate mix came in the 2013/2014 year. This is NOT a resort, but a true local ski area that also offers significant advanced terrain and side-country options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-14,5,Loved this place - great slopes for all different levels of skiers - from black diamond son to green-slope mamma (me) - we all enjoyed our day!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-14,4,"BB w/ it's new Schlasmans lift (or however you spell it) is the real deal. This resort is a powder pigs delight and if you like to hike, you're in heaven. Hit up a local to show you around the mtn. Real friendly &amp; kind folk for the most part.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-14,4,"Great skiing, great ski instructors, great equipment rental...oh and fabulous FRIES! Bridger is not just for the locals, this hidden gem is close to Downtown Bozeman - 25 minute drive and daily tickets cost less than the other ski resorts near by.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr-14,4,"Still owned by the community, new lifts this year for lower ability skiing people. While, the ridge terrain is some of the most extreme lift served anywhere. Only $50 for a ticket such a deal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-14,4,"A caution: No toilet facilities are at the sign-in cabin. So use the ones by the parking lot. A caution: Take the correct skis for the weather. (Otherwise, rent a pair.) The ice was slippery the day we went, so waxed skis were unsafe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-14,5,"We were recently here for a YSL ski championship race. The lift tickets are reasonable (esp. when compared to neighboring Big Sky!). We find the Virginia City lift super annoying, but once you get beyond that, there are plenty of high-speed lifts and lots of good terrain. Snow was great and there is certainly plenty of terrain no matter what your level. Really enjoyed our time here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-14,5,Our family vacation is to Bridger Bowl.\nThe staff is always friendly and the mountain is just awesome.\nI have skied many different mountains and I just Love this place.\nIt holds the snow great and what that means is it doesn't get wind swept like other mountains. \nThey have the best lift prices and a mom and pop feel to the place. Great for families with easy to extreme terrain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar-14,5,Over a year ago I rated Moonlight Basin as a superior value. That has now changed. This year Bridger Bowl installed two new chair lifts (Alpine and Powder Park) that provide better access to some really nice terrain--especially for skiing fresh powder and skiing through trees.\n\nMoonlight merged with Big Sky and is now very expensive--twice as much as Bridger. I will be staying close to home and skiing Bridger Bowl.\n\nThe main recommendation I would offer is to go early to get a decent parking space and to enjoy the uncrowded slopes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-14,3,"Very nice terrain, helpful staff. Need to get there early to avoid a long walk from the parking lot. Wish they had shuttle service from Bozeman on weekdays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-14,4,"Very friendly, helpful staff. Reasonably priced with the Powderhound deal. Good variety of runs for an intermediate skier over our four day stay. No crowds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-14,5,A great place after a nice snowfall. The Ridge Terrain is fantastic and offers fresh lines a couple of days after a big snow (beacon required.) Bridger Bowl felt a lot like the club fields in New Zealand without all the pretentiousness and gouging of larger resorts ($51 daily lift tickets!) It is a ski area designed for people that are more interested in skiing rather than prancing around the bar in the lodge showing off new ski clothes. Check the temperature forecast as it can get COLD! Real cold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-14,4,Loved skiing here. Had a couple of great powder days with the lightest drier powder I have ever seen. Went to Big Sky for a day but ended up coming back to Bridger because we liked it so much!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb-14,5,"For about $50 (adults) and almost nothing ($17) for kids, it's hard to beat Bridger. Food prices were also cheap and the staff was very friendly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
