Y,1,Discovery,Jayleigh D.,Florida,3/15/17,5,"This place was amazing!!! My first time snowboarding was here yesterday. Everyone had amazing customer service and was super personable from the guy at the counter when we arrived, to right before we left a guy running up to me telling me I left my things on the counter (oops!) haha. 

Hugh was my snowboard instructor. He spent two hours teaching me from scratch how to snowboard. He was SO nice, personable, and patient. You can tell he really loves what he does and loves snowboarding. It was fun to learn from someone who wants to teach! 

I learned how to do it and went snowboarding the rest of the day. It was so fun. 

The facility was super clean, and the cafeteria food was delicious, although I was bummed they ran out of veggie burgers! 

Will definitely come again!!! Thanks discovery, thanks Hugh!!!"
Y,2,Discovery,Bryon B.,Montana,1/10/22,1,"Myself along with my group of 6 people will never
be returning to Discovery. We refuse to fill the
pockets of owners that do not care about their
customers. The owner and the old lady were
beyond rude to my friends and family in an
emergency situation that happened to myself. I
was in the wrong in the situation and made an
honest mistake. The ski patrol had to stay an hour
late to get me to safety and they made it very
known how big of an inconvenience it was to help
me. How it was handled by Ciche and Beatriz was
completely unacceptable. After the incident, Ciche
and myself exchanged emails, where his
disrespectful attitude only continued. The point of
the email was to let them know how we felt they
had handled the situation wrong with their
attitudes and disrespect. The ski patrol did an
amazing job tracking me down but the attitude that
came with it was unacceptable. I hope nobody else
finds themselves in a bad situation at the mountain
because you will be treated like shit and I wish that
on nobodv."
Y,3,Discovery,Paul W.,Montana,1/16/22,2,We bought tickets and lessons for our 12 year old daughter. Due to Covid we had to postpone our trip for one week. Management would not reimburse us. Poor customer service.
Y,4,Discovery,Duane S.,Oregon,3/14/21,5,"This place is truly awesome in every way! Impeccable grooming everywhere, including some super steep slopes on the backside that require a winch cat. As far as terrain goes, very few areas come close. Steeper than Sun Valley, more great bowl and tree skiing than Big Sky. AND no lift lines on a weekend at a bargain price."
Y,5,Discovery,William L.,Montana,12/13/19,5,"My favorite ski hill in Montana. The snow pack varies from year to year, but when there is a decent base with a little fresh powder, it is incredible. Tons of really challenging stuff on the back side and lots of chill cruisers on the front. Both of my kids learned to ski in the Kinderski program at Disco, and they have both developed into excellent skiers for their age. Not really sure about the previous gal's negative review on Kinderski. Her kid must be a little weenie."
Y,6,Discovery,Michael R.,Washington,2/21/19,5,Great little location.  Fantastic variety of cruisers. Challenging double diamonds on the backside.  After years of going to Whistler it's nice to see a resort that is simply about skiing. Bargain prices . Goof parking. Low crowd. Great powder.
Y,7,Discovery,JK C.,Montana,1/23/18,5,"It's my favorite mountain in Montana. Reasonable prices, a variety of runs from noob to you-crazy, and an easy to get to location. Oh, and the bar and restaurant deliver too."
Y,8,Discovery,Ashley W.,Montana,2/16/19,1,Don't do kinderski unless you want your child to stand around for two hours. No one bothered to call the next day to discuss this concern as they said they would. Discussed with the owner and he made me feel bad for calling. Terrible experience. Do not recommend unless you want instructors to make your kid cry then ignore them. Incredible waste of money with the worst customer service and complete disregard for the well being of children I've ever experienced.
Y,9,Discovery,J A.,Montana,1/21/14,2,"The skiing is OK at Discovery, but probably not worth what they charge for a full day adult lift ticket. The snowpack is marginal year after year. It's low elevation and often gets some of the least amount of snow anywhere. When it does get a good dump, and if there happens to have a good base, the backside is some of the steepest and best skiing around. There are also a few fun cruiser runs. 

Beware when buying certain ticket products from these folks. Last year we bought a ""five pack"" of lift tickets that had ""no restrictions"" and were ""transferable."" I wasn't clear on whether they expired or not, so I called Discovery and asked the girl who answered if the five packs expired at the end of the season. I was told they did not. In fact my receipt for the purchase had all kinds of information about tickets, expiration dates for season passes, etc. but said nothing about the five pack expiring at the end of the season. The literature at the ski hill also says nothing about the five packs expiring at the end of the season. 

However, after driving more than 150 miles, when we went to redeem two of our three remaining tickets we were told that the tickets had expired. So our $160 got us two adult lift tickets. Big Sky rates! 

When I talked to the manager of the hill about this, he insisted that nobody there told me that the five packs didn't expire. He then went on to explain that they were counting on the fact that people like me wouldn't use all five of our purchased ski tickets. It seemed to me he was admitting that they were intentionally vague about the expiration so as to take advantage of people like me. I asked him if we could work something out, since I was told that they didn't expire. I offered to pay the difference between the increase in the price of the five pack if he'd honor the three remaining tickets on our pass, he scoffed at me and offered to sell me five tickets for $200, which is the normal adult rate.  

The manager was completely unwilling to take responsibility for an employee's assurances to me and instead essentially called me a liar, belittled me and went out of his way to be rude and insulting. 

There are definitely better choices for skiing out there. I know I won't be supporting this business again. I'll take my money, my bar tab, and my friends to a place that respects its customers."
Y,10,Discovery,Kathleen S.,Montana,1/31/17,1,"After mistakenly buying a lift ticket verses a college spring pass at Discovery, we asked to trade it in and pay the difference. We had the pass around 1 hour before realizing our mistake. But the manager said no & wouldn't budge one inch.  Praying that this poor dud gets some badly needed training in customer service as his comments were belittling!"
Y,11,Discovery,Mischa H.,California,12/30/16,5,"What a fantastic place for families to enjoy some skiing. Prices for rentals lessons etc very reasonable compared to where I'm from in CA. Laid back, staff is super helpful and kind, nice lodge, clientele is awesome. Beginning lessons are very well taught. My daughter took a beg ski class and I took a private lesson with Becky - she gave me incredible confidence and really understands how to teach to different learning abilities. Only recommendation is to get there early if renting equipment - they are really calm and efficient but there are a lot of people in line at 1030."
Y,12,Discovery,Dannielle K.,Montana,2/14/16,1,"For the price, long lines and the poor customer service I won't be returning not worth it!"
Y,13,Discovery,Rick C.,Washington,5/13/11,4,"Georgetown Lake, Montana:  this is where both of our sons learned to ski when they were ~ 4 years old.  It's thirty minutes from Anconda, MT and ~60 minutes from Butte, MT.  It's perfect for families but also challenging for the advanced skiiers and snowboarders.  The lifts become faster as you pick the more difficult runs.  Lift ticket prices are reasonable compared to California.  There are many long runs to be enjoyed.  And there are at least three difficult slopes with too many mogels I won't try."
