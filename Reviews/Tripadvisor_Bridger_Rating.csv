Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2013,5,"Overall it was a very good resort by our limited standards. The lifts were all running, the equipment and facilities were on par with most of the bigger ski resorts also. We only had an afternoon to get a few runs in and being so close we were able to not waste time driving to and from the bigger resort at Big Sky."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2012,5,What can I say GREAT place for anyone who loves the outdoors. Skiing is awesome! Their instructors are all awesome. Just a short drive from Bozeman.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2013,5,"Basic Info: Adult lift tickets for a full day are $49, although it's only $40 if you buy your lift ticket after 12:30 pm. Lift tickets for children and seniors are cheaper. The slopes close at 4 pm, at least on Fridays. The main lodge has a cafe, and there is a small gift shop located inside the rental office. Both lodges have locker rentals for 50 cents, and full-sized seasonal lockers are available for season rental. The parking lot is much larger than I expected, but after my visit (on a Friday afternoon) I realized that the place is probably packed on the weekends, with parking spots hard to come by. \n\nIf you are any skiing experience, you might as well skip the rest of my review because I am far from an expert skier- more like a good skier that is now many years out of practice. But Bridger Bowl has lots of slopes to choose from. There is a bunny slope which is fairly flat, but also very narrow considering it's full of kids learning to ski and people trying to figure out how to turn left and right. But it's a good place to get started. Sunnyside Trail is probably the next easiest trail. After that, they seem to get slightly more difficult, and I'm not going to presume to be able to rate the difficulty or comparability since I consider myself to be a novice (again)."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2012,4,"We love skiing Bridger Bowl! We usually only go skiing once a year (no hills near Fargo, ND!), and used to vary trips between Bridger Bowl and Big Sky/Moonlight. Bridger is obviously a smaller ski resort than Big Sky, but for the price and the customer service, it's hard to beat, especially if you use the Powerhound Package deal. There are a good variety of runs for Beginner and Intermediate skiers, and it looks like there are good runs for experts too, but we don't go on the expert-only lift up to the ridge (as I mentioned, we ski once/year!). There are a few black runs you can access from the mid-mountain lifts, so you can have a little adventure without committing to something crazy. The skiing at Bridger is always good, but what really stands out is their customer service. I'm not sure what kind of customer service training they do there, but it works! Everyone from the reservations people (so helpful!!), to the rental shop guys (again, really helpful), to the lifties (always in a good mood), to the servers in Jimmy B's restaurant (great service - especially from Larry!) are happy and helpful and glad you are there. Even the guys in the first aid cabin are great. Even if you don't need them, they have cool t-shirts for sale to support the rescue dogs! We also enjoy the other skiers at Bridger - they attract a much more friendly, down-to-earth crowd than Big Sky. If you fall down and have a ""yard sale"", there are always a bunch of people stopping to help and making sure you're ok. Embarrassing, but nice! Another nice advantage to skiing Bridger is staying in Bozeman. Lots of good restaurants, cool college town vibe, awesome co-op, etc. There are also a variety of nice places to stay at varying price points. We prefer the C'Mon Inn for the nice rooms, breakfasts, and multiple hot tubs. Hope you enjoy your time at Bridger. Tell Larry at Jimmy B's we said ""hi""!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2013,2,"Dress warm for this gem in the rough. Don't get me wrong I love the mountain it just needs a few fixes. Please add a buss from the parking lots well below the base lodge. add a high speed lift from the bottom so that when the wind blows (and it always blows) you get out of it faster. And lastly fix your anamometer, If I had known it was actually 20MPH I would not have driven up, I would have gone to nearby Yellowstone's North end."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2012,4,"I would rather board up at Big Sky, Moonlight, or Discovery any day over Bridger. Once I learned the mountain I began to like it, a few years ago when I lived in Bozeman I was really not a fan of it, but it is decent."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2013,3,"Bridger is a decent mountain that is only 15 miles from downtown Bozeman. There is a good sized bunny hill for the beginners and lots of intermediate terrain. For the more extreme skiiers, bring your transceiver and shovel to hike the ridge."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2012,4,Terrain for all level of skiers. Friendly staff and lots of fun! Highly recommend for families or anyone who likes to ski.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2013,5,"This place is is about 60% of the cost of nearby Big Sky. It's obviously a much smaller place, but it's fun and a great opportunity to try a different hill."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2012,4,"Writing a review for Bridger Bowl is difficult for me. After all, I'm a local and I go there. So really, I don't want to see it get any more crowded. But you just can't keep secrets these days.\n\nTo me, Bridger is like a throwback to the ""good old days,"" in that the place just seems down home and old-fashioned, which appeals to lots of folks. Of course, some of the ""good old days"" includes riding on ""old-timey"" lifts that take a long time to get up on the mountain. The Powder Park, Virginia City and Pierre's Knob lifts are all very slow.\n\nHere are my main recommendations for having a great time at Bridger: 1) If possible, don't go on the weekend. If you do then be sure to get there early since the parking lots fill up and you can expect to spend 15-25 minutes just unloading your gear, driving way down to find a parking place, then walking all the way back up to the lodge. You will also find annoying lift lines at the base at the Powder Park lift. 2) Don't go on a rather cold day. This is because the lifts are so slow and you will freeze sitting on them while you crawl up the mountain. Also, when it is busy, the lifts frequently stop and it seems to take a while to start back up. Not fun when it is 10 degrees and the wind is blowing (as it was yesterday while I was there). 3) Don't expect any deals if you have kids in the junior age range. I took my grand daughter who is 13 and had to pay full price. 4) Don't expect any deals if you are a ""senior."" Bridger doesn't give you a break until you are 70 years old. Most resorts I'm familiar with start the discount at around 65.\n\nIf you go to Bridger after some fresh powder it is fantastic. If you go on a weekday when it is not too terribly cold, you will have a great time. The base lodge and mid-mountain lodge are nice to duck into to warm up and get a good meal. Recommendation: it is MUCH easier to find a chair and table at the mid-mountain lodge than at the base on a weekend.\n\nHave fun!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2015,5,"The wide variety of terrain is what makes this hill a wonderful \nDestination!! No accomadation on the hill, there is a 20 min.\nDrive from Bozeman each morning.\nA great hill for all levels of skiers.\nNice restaurants, and 2 bars to choose from."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2015,3,A little bit of everything makes this an enjoyable experience for beginners to experts. Very nice choice of places to eat and drink as well.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2015,3,"Do not be fooled by the low price (1/2 of Big Sky) this is THE place to ski, weather you want steep and deep or first time terrain. Friendly natives and a great trip. No housing and you ned to drive back to Bozeman each day (16 miles)"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,5,"8 lifts -- all modern. The ski rental people are super nice and helpful. If you are an intermediate or beginner skier this place is made for you. If advanced, there is a special area for you- if you are aptly equipped. Prices were awesome today $52 for a full day adult ticket!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2014,5,"We can never get enough of Bridger Bowl! Coming from the east coast you never know what the conditions are going to be but out of the few powder days we ever had most were here. Inexpensive, beautiful mountain with gorgeous snow."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2015,5,"Great trails, no lift lines. Conditions were not the best as they had not had new snow. Will definitely be back."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2015,5,The snow when we were there was excellent. There is a very good choice of runs for all levels of skiers. There are also an abundance of lodges both at the base and on the hill. The prices are the lowest of any ski hills in this class.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2015,5,"Bridger Bowl is a class act from beginning to end! I have skiied for nearly 40 years at many resorts throughout the U.S. I regularly ski in Colorado. My experience at Bridger was the best. Everyone I met was friendly, helpful and professional. The skiing was awesome, helped by almost a foot of new powder, but that seemed to only be the icing on the cake. There were no lines - on a powder weekend day!!! There was plenty of variety, and easy to find the way to the various lifts and ski areas. The rental shop, especially the manager, were the best I've seen. Thanks for a great time. I'd go back to Bridger before Big Sky anytime."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2014,4,"This is another ski hill we hit on our Montana trip. The entire lower part of the mountain is dedicated to blue and green runs while the top of the mountain is almost exclusively blacks. As a beginner, I appreciated the variety of blues and greens. The blues at Bridger do not seem as steep as the blues at other rocky Mtn ski hills I have been to. My favorite run was Alpine Return/Timmys Road/Summer Road. When skied together, this run will take the better part of 15-20 minutes. And the best part is that you get challenging and fun terrain for the low price of $52 for a lift ticket. That is over $50 less than Big Sky (not that these ski hills are even close to being the same class though). All in all, we had a very fun day at Bridger."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2014,3,Ski instructors are very good and again their prices are very reasonable. There are enough ski options on the mountain to make it adventurous without being overwhelming.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jul 2012,3,"We have been to Big Sky skiing several times and had great skiing. A friend suggested we try Bridger Bowl for a great day of skiing, and we were so glad we took their advice. \nAlthough it is a relatively small ski area, don't let that fool you,.\nThey get great powder, and there are long runs for every level of skier. \nBridger Bowl is such a short drive from Bozeman, we enjoy staying there and being on the ski hill soon. Wouldndefinitelynrecommend to any level of skier."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2012,3,"Bridger Bowl is certainly the best ""local"" ski area in the Rockies, and perhaps in the country. The ""cold smoke"" powder days, although rare, cannot be forgotten. Bridger has runs ranging from beginning to extreme (i.e., hike up to the ridge with a partner and other equipment). Bridger has been featured in several movies.\nDon't tell anyone about Bridger because the lift lines are still usually short-to-none, and this is a non-profit ski area: The lift tickets are very reasonable.\nThere is no lodging at the base, although the food is very good. You have to drive (or take a bus) from and to Bozeman, about 20 minutes. Big deal! This is not like Big Sky and/or Moonlight Basin, which are about 45-60 minutes from Bozeman. You might want to ski both areas and compare the experience. The people you meet at Bridger, including locals and others from distant places like Minnesota, North Dakota, and Canada, are usually very friendly and entertaining, at least for a ""local"" like me. Many of my best memories are from Bridger Bowl."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2011,4,"We holidayed in Bozeman in December 2011 and had a day skiing at Bridger Bowl. Staff were super helpful to my party of 8 Aussies who didn't ski or have the right gear! Youngest 10 year old benefitted from ski lessons with her own personal trainer. While only a fee ski runs, we had a full day of skiing and the cafe sold superb warm food. Looking forward to returning in 2013."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2012,5,Such an easy place to enjoy a day of skiing. Plenty of challenge but not the big resort attitude.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,May 2012,5,Sooooo close to town; only 15 minutes away it is a hidden treasure!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Nov 2011,5,"Varied and challenging terrain. No attitudes, just friendly people having fun."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2012,3,"We added a ski day at Bridger Bowl before heading to Big Sky for a week,and are SO glad we did! It ended up being the 'best day of the year' per one of the regulars there--lots a fresh powder and great conditions. It was actually the best powder skiing day of our week. It was a busy Sunday but lines weren't bad at all. The ticket prices make this a super value. We talked to a family in the clean lodge (good rest rooms) and they absolutely love their local ski spot. We did too--there's something there for everyone!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2012,3,Right from the first phone call to book a trip the ladies were friendly and easy to work with. We made multiple changes on our itinerary and never had an issue. There were no surprises when we arrived other than the depth of the powder that we had to plow through on the hill. We were at Bridger for 4 days and it dumped snow every day. This was one of the best snowboard trip trips I have made.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2011,4,Greatest ski resort in the USA - cool people steep runs and cold smoke.....
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2012,4,After a foot of new snow overnight skied Bridger Bowl on a bluebird Montana day. Whille it was crowded for here..I still had fresh tracks at noon in 3Bears Bowl. \nThe 'cold smoke' is legendary dry powder that makes skiing memorable. It is a quintessential Rocky mountain ski resort without the glitz and glamor...just honest pricing and incredible skiing.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2019,5,"My 12 year old son had 5 days of private lessons twice daily. We really got to know John Saam. He has awesome people skills, and helped him go from learning to stop and turn to spending the last two days on Green runs. My son developed confidence in his ability to ski. I followed close behind. If you want to learn to ski and are headed to Bridger Bowl. John Saam is a must! You will love his style &amp; patience.\n\nAs well, you will love the women in the Ski School office. Peggy, Jennifer &amp; Shannon are fantastic. Fantastic week!!! Remember, John Saam - The King of all that's skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2019,5,"From the staff to the slopes, this place is one of the best kept secrets! The lift tickets are reasonable compared to other area ski places. The ski/snowboard rentals were fairly priced as well. Many slopes to experience and explore. We did not get bored skiing/snowboarding here and we skied 4-7 days. We had a personal dilemma that the staff handled so kindly and professionally. It was a great experience!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Oct 2019,4,"Our University hosts took us out to Bridger Bowl for dinner as part of our site visit. The place was remarkably empty (not snowy enough for skiing and too snowy for summer sports), so we had the place to ourselves. The lodge was a good dinner venue, with considerable variety in beers and plenty decent food. I'd like to see it in full operation at some point."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Aug 2019,5,"We were guests at a private affair in late August. The food was excellent, bar choices ample, and the ambience lovely. The room is spacious enough to hold a couple hundred guests and we were by no means crowded."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Aug 2019,3,"What a find. I’m recommending this quaint ski destination to my sons. How nice to find a family friendly resort that isn’t so mammoth you feel like you are competing with the world. Only 16 miles up the hill from Boseman, many lifts to offer variety. Wish I still could ski and I’d definitely go back."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2019,3,Had a pass this year and was absolutely blessed. The beauty is unsurpassed. The runs are so outstanding. The people are lovely. The warming huts are inviting and a great place to visit. You won't ski many more wonderful places.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr 2019,4,"Great place. I took the group lessons both sessions . The teachers were amazing , patient, kind, talented and fun. The kitties were polite, bathrooms clean. It certainly had plenty of skiing for our family. \nBeautiful scenery and close to town. For me it was wonderful. \nThe restaurants had decent prices and food was fine- typical pub food. Great beer selection too."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2019,3,"I dislike all the big mega resorts with their arrogant attitudes and exorbitant prices. If you feel similar go to Bridger Bowl. It is only 16 miles outside of Bozeman, but you do not see the resort until you are about 0.5 miles away. It has the most natural appearance and feeling of all resorts I have visited. There is ample amount of skiing terrain for the majority of skiers for a few days and if you are an expert, you just hit the jackpot. Don't forget your avi beacon if you decide to go to the expert level ridge terrain. Food prices are reasonable with hamburgers at $4 and great taco salad at $10. Tasty food as well.\nOnly con is that it aims for local clientele. Very few signs and directions at resort of where to go to park, drop off area and how to go to hit slopes, etc. Hey, but if I must act confused or ask questions so be it. Loved this place."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2018,4,"I got to know Bridger Bowl when I was in graduate school years ago. It was a quick 20+ minutes from Montana Hall to the mountain. The hill offers some tough terrain, some good moguls, a park at the top, and lots of diversity. Further, Bridger Bowl was the home many years for the college national downhill skiing championship. People are friendly, the skiing is good, and it's reasonably priced. Try Bridger."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2019,5,My daughter and I went here and took some lessons. The staff from the very beginning were so nice to deal with. They made sure we had everything we needed and were very nice. The pricing is very fair especially for people who are just starting the ski journey. Overall we had a great time and were impressed with the service here. We would recommend this place to beginners for sure.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2011,3,"We skied here 1 out of our 4 days skiing and enjoyed it more than Big Sky. For $47, you can't beat this as compared to $81 for Big Sky ($77 online). Nice little place, but after a day we had skied most everything.\n\nIf you're in the area, you need to try out Bridger Bowl."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2011,3,"Value was decent at $50 for lift ticket and $25 rentals. Good variety of skiing. Dining options were good considering this is a community owned ski area.\n\nLift guys could possibly be a bit more courteous since we arent all expert skiers. A few miles outside Bozeman but no big deal, just be careful driving if very early in the mornings."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,4,"I've skiied Bridger Bowl in 2001, 2003 &amp; 2006. This place never fails to please with great snow and short waits in line. I've skiied a few places in Tahoe and the East Coast, plus a few in Montana--Big Sky &amp; Moonlight Basin--but Bridger is always my favorite. The lift ticket price is reasonable, the locals who frequent the place are so friendly and the staff is very cool. This ski slope has something for everyone from beginner to expert and it's not far from downtown Bozo. If I had to pick a place to go back to over and over again, I'd pick Bridger Bowl."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,5,"My husband, two sons (ages 9 and 11) and I visited Bridger Bowl and skiied for four days over the New Year's holiday. We researched this place on Trip Advisor and their website and it looked like a low-key, family friendly place for beginning skiers. Well, we were right!\n\nWe're used to skiing in California, which is generally crowded when the conditions are good. But at Bridger there was never a line, the snow was amazing, everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful, including the other skiers, the prices were very reasonable and we had a fantastic experience.\n\nI especially recommend this place for families with young children who are looking to introduce them to skiing. The staff-to-patron ratio is amazing. My kids and I took a ""group"" lesson and we each got our own instructor. My older son decided to switch from snowboard to skis on the second day - no hassles. We just went to the rental shop and they swapped him out. There is a very good selection of runs for the very beginning to the very advanced, so those who want more of a challenge won't be disappointed. The lodges have good food, reasonably priced and are really clean and scenic looking facilities. The mountain views are beautiful.\n\nThere isn't much loding immediately adjacent, but there is plenty of lodging in Bozeman, which is just 16 miles away. The drive is an easy one and the road is always plowed. There is also a bus that will take you to Bridger from Bozeman for free if you don't want to drive.\n\nI really can't recommend this place enough."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,4,"Awesome! i'm the worst skier ever, yet i had a blast. this is a must for everyone! skis and snowboards are available at amazing rental costs. bring your warm clothes 'cause it gets chilly! have fun!\n"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,5,"From begining to end Bridger Bowl is the best and least expensive ski area in MT. I've been to Big Sky and Bridger and if you're interested in some serious powder runs without the crowd hassle, got to Bridger Bowl.... It's Awesome..\n"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jun 2012,5,We visit from Minnesota and love skiing at Bridger Bowl. Variety of skiing types and difficulty for the family. Moderately priced and clean lodges. Staff are helpful with great ski instructors!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,4,"Great value! Ticket prices are reasonable, food and rental options are great, and just 16 miles from Bozeman. Highly recommend this beautiful ski area!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jul 2012,4,"Attended son's wedding in July 2012, held at the mid-hill lodge. Easily accessible facility big enough for several hundred at least. Tables, chairs, etc included in the rental fee so you don't have to rent and haul them. Catering also did a great job. A most ""Montana"" place that our out-of-state guests enjoyed. Only caution: warn your guests to bring flat soled shoes to wear if the ceremony is held out on the deck, which is made of grating (so that snow will fall through during ski season). The grating eats high heels!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2012,3,"We have had mid-week season passes to BB for the past several years. When we first arrived in Bozeman, I thought, well, we might ski here occasionally. But skiing one or two days a week all season really improved our skiing. The treed routes (they are not official runs) are what MAKE the mountain for us. And of course, there is always the Ridge to move up too, once you get good enough."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,3,"Large variety of trails. Cheap and very friendly!!! Good food, only 20 min away from Bozeman. Love it,"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2012,3,"nice skiing, and not with the 'be there and be seen' crowd. You want to ski or look good? go for the skiing. Lines at the lifts are not horrible. Go for it!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Aug 2012,4,Food was fantastic and the area was easy to get to - right out of Bozeman - if I were a winter sport person - I would visit Bridger!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Aug 2012,4,Went there to hike outside Bozeman. Easy to get to off of Rte 86. Well marked entrace and it can be as leisurely or as strenuous as you like. Have a good time but bring plenty of water!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Aug 2011,4,"Bridger bowl is probably not as elite as Big Sky, but it's so much fun. Snow wasn't great this year and was glad we didn't go... hopefully this year."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jul 2012,4,"Bridger Bowl claims its a world class community ski hill. It delivers everything it promises. Granted I might be bias seeing how this is where I learned to ski, but it offers something for every level of Skier. Alpine Meadows lift is the perfect lift for folks just learning. Slushmans is every skiers backcountry wet dream. Only down side to Slushmans is lines on powder days. If your in Bozeman for a ski trip and are skiing Big Sky and Moonlight, do yourself a favor and take a day or three up to Bridger."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2014,4,$25 for a lift ticket and 5 dollar rentals. Being old never seemed so good !! :-) leaver your boards at home !! Bridger is to Big Sky as Targhee is to Jackson Hole.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2014,5,"We had an amazing time at Bridger. They have slopes for all levels and their prices are really affordable. The lines were very manageable with the upper slopes in particular being challenging yet fun. Additionally, the lodge has a ton of amenities and the bar there is the perfect place for apres ski."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2014,5,"used the marketing dept for a powder hound package what a great deal. cannot get any more service I felt like i was famly as every one could not do enough . every question answered every need met . they just made myself and companions have an ski experience of a lifetime . thank you all marketing , shop staff , lifties ,ski storage and mountian hosts . world class people . The bowl has the steeps and terrain to excite all two boys packed up to the ridge and evry bit of advice they where given and photos made it the adventure of a lifetime .\n\nGreat place"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2014,5,"We stayed and skiied 4 days over Christmas and New Years. We were blessed with excellent conditions and fantastic skiing. Even during the holidays new lift options kept line very short and there was a nice variety of terrain to explore. Lodge facilites were stupendous and prices reflect the non profit nature. This place is awsome for family skiing and we were entertained each day with the sights of the Ridge Runners desending the chutes and traverses. We very much enjoyed the live music, fireworks and torchlight parade the evening before New Years. The resort is very close to Bozeman...about a fifteen minute drive... but, the curves at the beginning of the canyon deserve respect. Get there early and you are rewarded with premium parking."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2013,5,"Bridger Bowl, located a mere twenty minutes from Bozeman Montana, is a great ski area. Bridger has eight ski lifts. With these lifts, you can access terrain that works for any level of ability. More often then not, lines are short or non-existent. Rarely, you will have a moderate lift line, usually on powder days. You can ride up Bridger Lift and then hike onto the Ridge of this mountain. Tons of unmarked runs off expert level can be reached off of the Ridge. They range from steep chutes to wide open powder fields. In my opinion, the best part of this local ski area is the vibe it carries. Everyone is friendly and as stoked to be there as you will be. I ski there all the time, and I love every minute I spend on the mountain."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2013,3,Great terrain for a medium size Mountain. Location is 16 miles from Bozeman so stay in Bozeman and drive!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2013,3,I work up at Bridger and am always stoked on powder days. Schlushmens lift brings you to some rad steeps and plentiful powder skiing. Love this hometown resort. Don't forget your apres ski/board beer at Jimmy B's.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr 2013,5,great skiing at a hill close to Bozeman. Takes only 30 minutes (if that) to drive there. Great snow and runs.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2013,5,"Great mountain and fine folks. No overnight accommodations, unless you check with Bridger Bowl's central reservations. Those folks will set you in the right direction and they will also book lift tickets, lessons, rentals, even daycare sessions with ski lessons for the little tykes."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2013,4,"We are so grateful for this local ski hill that serves families and extreme skiers alike. Reasonable prices, brown-bag friendly lodge, and beginner slope make it great for families. An avalanche transceiver and shovel open up endless extreme terrain. FUN!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2012,4,"Bridger's snow is crappy and so are the people. Go to Showdown, located about 2 hours north near Monarch and Neihart. They have champagne powder and every one has a smiling face. Never a line either. Amazing!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,4,"Bridger Bowl is a gem. Short lines, usually tons of snow, cheap tickets and almost zero commercialization. A non-profit hill that ranks on many top 20 lists. Bozeman is a great place to spend a week (or longer) and is only 16 miles or so from Bridger. What are you waitng for?"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2011,4,"IN Plato’s allegory of the cave, the famous philosopher describes humanity as living in an unenlightened cave, blind to the true, epicurean pleasures of life, waiting to be led out of their wretched existence. Wretched is the word I would use to accurately describe East Coast skiing, days of ice and slippery slopes, impossible to find traction or garner thrill from truly challenging slopes. When my parents put me on a plane to Montana with my siblings, I was being led out of my metaphorical cave of tepid and halfhearted downhill. For the first time at Bridger Mountain, I was experiencing truly challenging skiing.\n\nOur arrival at the slopes was shortly accompanied by three feet of powder fall, as the temperature drop to under ten degrees, perfect snow for skiing in. Heaven is the only word for it, heaven with a few numbed extremities. It was almost ethereal. The enjoyment of it was blinding, racing through waist deep powder.\n\nBridger Mountain is also different from other resorts in that it is less of a resort and more of a heavily ski based lodge and slopes. The sheer size of the mountain was amazing. There are nearly three times as many runs as the local slopes in my native Cincinnati, and the large majority are black diamonds, with a hefty section of double-black diamonds too. But if fast is not your style, there are long winding greens and blues to choose from too. Even if I had become bored with those slopes there is still the backwater skiing through the uncharted west side of the mountain through Slashman’s Canyon and Mundy’s Bowl, the truly untouched areas.\n\nThe lodge is cozy too, with a well-supplied cafeteria and nearby lodging for those who want to stay on site, but there are also places to stay and eat of the slopes. And if you get tired of skiing altogether there is still Bozeman, a small city thirty away.\n\nFrom the slopes to the service, Bridger Bowl in Montana has truly opened my eyes to the joys of skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2012,5,Snow was a bit sparse (very unusal for this time of year) but we had great fun and the sunshine made up for the lack of snow!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2011,5,This is the best place to ski. The lift opp's are super friendly with the little kids. There is plenty of terrain for everyone from the begginger to the advanced. This is a east facing mountain range so it holds its snow extremely well. Rent the proper eq. and find someone to take you to the ridge if you are a good skier. We do the Powder Hound package. This is the best place to take your family for a great ski vacation without taking out a loan...
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2011,5,"We skied over Xmas 2011 since not enough to open all lift we got tickets for $20! For us, we are beginner/intermediate skiers so the lifts that were open were perfectly fine for us. Plus two beautiful lodges to eat lunch in. What a hidden gem this ski resort is. Not too crowded, no wait on the ski lifts. Would highly recommend."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,5,"Every time I've gone there (about 10 times each year, for the last 7 yrs) the trails are well groomed, they have lots of terrain, and they're adding more, and the people are nice. Why I like them more than Big Ski is because one year I went to Big Sky and the said they had a 72"" base, BUT THEY LIED😡!!! I spent the whole day either skiing in slush or on rocks."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2011,4,"Montana has had little snow this year, but our trip to Bridger Bowl was still a fun day on the slopes. The lines were almost ZERO wait all day long."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2011,5,"Big Sky is expensive and chi-shi. BB is the place is where the locals like to ski. Prices are fair and the place is owned by the taxpayers, not some fancy California corporation. Located in a scenic valley much closer to the downtown and airport."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Nov 2011,4,"great place, very extremely challenging. always has snow, great town, and lodging, great food, pubs, whatever you need. only 16 miles up the canyon rd"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2020,4,"This is rated as one of the best skiing experiences anywhere by more than one magazine—&amp; many people “in the know”! It’s BEAUTIFUL! Shuttles are available from Bozeman, which make it very convenient because parking is quite limited, by design.\n\nIn summer months, this is a beautiful area to drive &amp; hike, too—just be sure to wear good hiking shoes &amp; always carry plenty of water &amp; BEAR SPRAY."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2020,4,"It's hard to beat the combo of great skiing, less than hour from Bozeman, laid back atmosphere and great pricing. From extreme to beginner, you will find what you want. Plus, they have had many updates to lifts in recent years. I almost hate to write this review because I love no lift lines."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2020,5,"I love BB! Easy to get there, convenient parking and set up. Pricing was what I expected - around $100 for ticket &amp; gear for the day. Very efficient getting outfitted with equipment. I didn't wait on a lift the entire day - ski up and get on. I know my limits and stay on the easy to intermediate runs and there were plenty. Great variety and no surprises. Lunch was reasonable and efficient. All around great day."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2020,5,"Bridgers 1st Steeps Clinic was awesome. The Ski School set these clinics up perfectly with the Steeps first, then Intro to Ridge, to Ridge tactics. Bridger is my favorite place because it’s like my home hill, only longer, and steeper. I plan on going back next year, maybe twice for the Ridge. Th@nks Joe and Crew!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2020,4,"Hit this mountain on a powder day, a Friday. Had a great day, staff was friendly, mountain has tons of variety, they were quite busy but lines were very manageable. Will certainly ski here again"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2020,5,"I'm not much of snow boarder (nor ski person), however, it was the best one I ever visited.\nComing from Los Angeles, I've been Bigbear, Mammoth, Charleston in Vegas, and a few smaller places. \nThis place is definately better. \nWe stopped by on the way to Yellowstone North gate as we had couple extra days. Loved it, so returned after Yellowstone visit.\nIt has several bigining courses for my boys and biginning/intermediate course which was not too scary for beginner but long enough to enjoy the ride.\nWe even thought about flying from Los Angeles in future just for the snowboard/ski.\n"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2020,5,"My husband and I bought a midweek ski package from Bridger Bowl. This included skiing at Bridger and staying at the Element in downtown Bozeman. We loved both experiences and highly recommend this package! Fern Corwin from Bridger coordinated the details. She was so kind and easy to contact and we even got to meet her in person when we were at Bridger. If you can get away for midweek skiing this is the BEST- no crowds, no lift lines, and lunch at Alpine cabin mid mountain.\nThe Element has a lobby breakfast that is beautiful and bountiful and also a relaxing happy hour . We plan to return next winter."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2019,5,"Nice drive from Bozeman. Our 1st trip here for Family ski trip with adults, teens &amp; small kids, this was perfect for all. Really liked the kids fenced area to warm up or learn to ski with small lift, this is nice. The staff at all of the lifts were great &amp; kind. Great runs for all the family from black to beginner. Decent price for lifts, thank you. The only problem we had was finding a seat at lunch, all lodges were very full. We will definitely ski here again!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2019,5,"Someone we know recommended Bridger Bowl because it had good skiing and it was economical (if that word can be used when taking a family skiing) compared to other resorts in the Rockies. We spent 10 days in Bozeman through Christmas and had a great time. The skiing is really good and is a bit of a hidden gem as long as you have not been spoiled by some of the resorts that offer high speed, heated lifts and ski in/out villages at the bottom of the mountain. We've enjoyed those amenities also but going this time of year also impacts the cost of lift tickets quite a bit. We paid $65 which was $100 less/ticket than Big Sky. Big Sky is 50 miles south of Bozeman, it offers all the things you can imagine in a ski resort and you will pay dearly for everything. Bridger Bowl is a no frills mountain. It does have one small cafe 1/2 way down one of the runs and a couple of places at the bottom of the mountain to get grilled food. There Is no logging on the mountain. You drive in each day or there's a bus that runs from Bozeman which is about 20 minutes away. You'll need something other than an American Express to pay because they don't accept that card. In spite of the sparce accommodations we really enjoyed ourselves. The skiing is great and the runs were not crowded at all. I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try as long as you're good with simple and not looking for the total resort experience. You'll definitely save some money."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2019,3,The hill is very heavily used and ridden that it was ruts/ice from people’s boards. Biggest problem is they need more snow (not their fault). Lots of very nice people to talk to. The lodge and bar were completed packed and it was hard to find anywhere to sit. Overall a good day.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2017,4,"Bridger Bowl is an amazing ski area, great runs, close to Bozeman and reasonable prices. Beautiful setting and easy access. Definitely a must ski area!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2017,4,"The signage to get to the ski rental place was confusing, but once we were there we foudn excellent customer service. The slopes were beautiful -- we stayed on the Alpine hill since we are beginnners, and we had a great day!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,5,"Bridger Bowl is a great place to ski and ride. Wide variety of terrain to satisfy any skill level. Laid back, friendly attitude. A very well kept local secret, weekdays almost never have lift lines."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2016,5,Our son loves this place. He goes every chance he gets. They do schooling events that the kids cant wait for that is all they talk about.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2016,4,A great steep mountain. Usually over looked by big sky but no ones sad about that. Very local spot!!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2016,5,"Great skiing, has something for everyone. Good runs. Nice friendly staff. Much smaller than Big Sky and less expensive. Nice in the summer too for day hikes."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,5,"Bozeman, has some great skiing. I have 2 girls (10 and 7 ) and thought they'd love to learn to ski during a work trip one year. So we went to Big Sky during spring break. If you've been there, it's amazing! the kids got comfortable and there were not a lot of folks around. Fast forward 1 year, another work trip and I decided to bring the family up too. Big Sky, for it's amazingness, is pretty $$$$. We decided to try Bridger at the behest of the locals. My girls, being girls, freaked out at the lack of familiarity for their 2nd time skiing. I assure you, once they were done, the reviews of Bridger were all 5 star for them. Loved the mountain, the staff was so nice and wonderful and helpful. to me, that's what important. It didn't break the bank, it was good skiing, and my family felt warm and welcome. We'll ski there anytime. Very worth a visit"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2015,4,"Great place for skiers of all ages and abilities. I've been skiing here for 32 years, started in college and raised my kids on these slopes. We have skied plenty at Big Sky and Moonlight, but we always come back to Bridger. It's our hometown hill -- lots of variety in the terrain and technical difficulty, plenty of vertical thrills, good prices and great food. Don't miss the fries!! The ski school is top notch and it is just so friendly and convenient."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Sep 2016,4,I grew up and learned to ski at Bridger. Although it has changed a lot since I was a kid I still like Bridger over Big Sky or any other ski hill in the area. The skiing is fantastic and they have made many improvements in the past 10 years to make the skiing even better. I have been to a few weddings at the Jim Bridger and one at the Deer Park Chalet and those are stunning! I love Bridger and I always will!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2016,3,"There is plenety of sking for all skill levels here and low to no waiting in lines, even weekends. The ski tickets are quite reasonable. This is a nice place to take a break from the crowds and enjoy a place the locals call home. Ski scools are top notch and are kept small."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2021,4,"Once Again Bridger Bowl Skiing was a total blast. John Saams - awesome ski instructor crushed it. We worked with him twice a day for 5 days two years ago, and last week he was terrific as well. Anyone wanting a great ski experience should reach out to Bridger Bowl in Bozeman for ski lessons and wonderful skiing for all levels. Even great skiers would enjoy this local resort. \n\nA shout out to the women in the Ski School office. Peggy, Jennifer &amp; Shannon are fantastic.\n\nJohn Saams - The King of all that's skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2022,2,"Took family on 2 seperate days during a vacation to ski at Bridger Bowl- the first day was wonderful-rented from Bridger Bowl-had great equipment and experience but on the next visit-had to rent from Roadhouse Sports-just across parking lot from Bridger Bowl- equipment was faulty and put my kids life at risk- when one child had to walk down mountain because board too small-she returned to rental place- the girl who rented said ""OH I KNEW YOU WOULDNT BE ABLE TO STAY UP BUT OH WELL"" and my other daughters skis would not stay locked to boot appropriately--after 2 rescues from ski partrol- they noted the defective skis and apologized but said it was a bad rental place-both girls never skiied that day and left in tears- WOULD NEVER RENT FROM THEM-they knowingly put MY DAUGHTERS LIFE AT RISK for a rental fee!!!!!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2021,5,"Lots of long runs, variety and different levels of difficulty. Helpful and friendly staff. Torchlight parade and fireworks were extra special. Food is expensive so bring your own lunch/snacks."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2021,5,"Family skiing after Christmas Day! So lovely! Nice powder, groomed runs and a fun grill with local brews at the end of a perfect day!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2021,4,"Purchased all day ski passes online in advance. In theory this should’ve saved time upon arrival. This was the biggest downside of our day at Bridger Bowl. We waited for close to 2 hours to get the passes and rent equipment. Now for the praise: one of our sons got sick after I paid for his equipment and pass. I visited the ski services area and spoke to a manager who transferred his day pass and equipment rental to a different day. The staff also helped us after learning my husband was in a car wreck on his way to pick up two of us, and our shoes were in the damaged vehicle! They found us some lost and found shoes so we didn’t have to wear socks off property that night. My son and I took the bus service from the ski area to the Bozeman fair grounds and got an Uber from there back to our hotel in Bozeman. Beautiful ski area for all ski levels."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2021,5,"I've never been skiing before. I booked a snowboard lesson for the morning on a Saturday in March. The instructors were great and there were only 3 people in my group so it was easy to learn the basics. Wish we had more time going down the slopes with the instructors. We basically got 2 turns each, but I understand most of the lesson was learning how to move the board. I would come again. Also, the process with booking reservations online and everything being done with covid procedures went smoothly."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr 2021,4,"Out of 4 of us, I’m the skier who sticks to greens because I’m anxious.\nThis was my idea of a perfect day of skiing. The worst part was the very end by the lifts. Very chill, beautiful views everywhere. My kids and husband had a great day on other runs. 11 yo said “best day skiing ever” he’s been to Breckinridge 3 times, and park city - so I’d say high praise.\nI’d love to come here again."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2021,5,"Snow was amazing, views were amazing, staff was amazing. Simply one of the best ski areas in the U.S. for experienced skiers who like to hang out with, and be around, other skiers. But also very family friendly. Saw as many young families as I saw hard core skiers going off the edge."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2021,5,"This was our first time skiing here and it was great. Tons of wide well groomed runs which was nice. Not a lot of people due to covid pre purchase requirements. Not a ton of moguls and what was there was very manageable. My 46 year old legs don’t appreciate moguls anymore, and most of the resort is groomed so it was enjoyable. To be honest the coverage was a little sparse, but not much the resort can do about that. The drive to the resort was super easy. No scary mountain road drive at all. Good parking and excellent amenities. We didn’t go up to the top of the ridge at all, but if you are looking for some steep drops and shoots they have it. Adult ticket was $65 I think and my 15 year old was only $40. Excellent experience."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2020,4,"I grew up skiing on this hill, so it's a special place for me. Usually smaller crowds and certainly cheaper prices than nearby Big Sky. The terrain can be quite challenging if you're prepared to look for it. The only reason I marked a four star was because I went early in the year before enough snow had accumulated and the slopes were a bit ""gravelly"". It will pick up soon and be great skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,5,"Compared to some of the other ski hills around the area this place is a heck of a deal! Awesome skiing, more of a skiers hill than snowboarders but either way you will have a good time for a great price!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2014,5,"We love to ski Bridger Bowl. That is why we come back every year. Awesome family ski hill, lift tickets are a fair price, friendly, well run resort."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2014,5,Skip the lines and high prices at Big Sky and enjoy the local flare at Bridger Bowl. I haven't been in 10 years and they have made some wonderful improvements to the chair lifts! I had the best day last week. The ski rentals at the slope were affordable and the staff friendly and knowledgeable. I can't wait to go back to this hidden gem!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,5,"We 've been coming here on and off for about 10 years. We drive all the way from Chicago for week or 10 days of fun on a slopes. We ski here during Christmas/ New Year break and during spring break and both times are great for skiing. Big area and not too many people, a lot of runs for beginners and intermediate. Top part of bowl is too difficult for me. Prices are lower than any ski area around Chicago and half of price of Big Sky. Very friendly staff, great prices for ski lessons."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2014,4,"We skied Bridger Bowl twice while staying at Big Sky because the weather was not cooperating with producing snow cover. While we were skiing over rocks at Big Sky, Bridger Bowl was almost completely open with about the same snow cover. The staff was very friendly and the early season rates were very good. There is a good variety of terrain to choose from and no crowds. Bridger Bowl is an easy drive from Bozeman which allows for more of a variety of lodging to choose from. The view from the summit is beautiful also."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2014,3,"This is a local ski slope just outside of Bozeman. Big Sky is 1.5 hours away, but Bridger is 20 minutes. The lift tickets are very reasonable and the place is not crowded. I didn't feel cheated by a half day of skiing because the prices are low."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Oct 2014,5,"This is within easy driving distance of Bozeman, and the steep trails up to the ridge offer spectacular views over the local landscape. Highly worth a visit for a short hike that can either be strenuous, or you can follow the trails for an easy walk"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Sep 2014,4,"Service was great but game food on a pizza? Just was not for me. Growler? I'm a city slicker---never heard of one. Saw people carrying this ""jug"" around and ask what is this. Then I bought one!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Aug 2014,5,The drive up to the Bridger mountains is so scenic! There are many hiking trails - with all different skill levels. It is a very family-friendly area. Great place for a wedding reception.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2014,5,"We love Bridger Bowl. It is a great local ski area. The lift ticket prices are very reasonable. And, the restaurant that is on site is very good. We had a burger and a local brew for lunch."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2013,4,"Close to Bozeman, good slopes, made it perfect for skiing during school. The price of the tickets were reasonable. Parking was ok."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Sep 2013,5,"my husband and I travel every year on a road trip the ski resorts to see where we want to go in the winter. Although the resort is closed now, the views getting there were stunning and the mountain looks great for a good local vibe. nothing fancy just good skiing"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2013,5,We've had season passes here for years but the day rates are the most reasonable around. Family oriented and a great value. Views from the top of Alpine lift are spectacular! Love Bridger Bowl!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2013,5,"Bridge, which is co-owned by the city and University, offers a superb, friendly, and challenging opportunity away from the crowds, hustle, and glamor of the big resorts. The staff is the most important feature, and here they shine...and the food is both delicious and modestly priced. The National Ski Patrol trains here yearly on mountain rescue, and the steeps at the peaks are most challenging...give it a try, and you will be ;changed for life"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2013,5,"Live in Bozeman and have skied at Bridger Bowl for the last 24 years. Excellent terrain for all levels of skiing. Generally uncrowded during the week, with the exception of the week between Christmas and New Years and the week of Presidents' Day. Perfect for those who like a friendly atmosphere and friendly people."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2013,5,"Love the meadows. They will be getting a new chair lift taking you over to the meadows. Foods okay, bar is good."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2012,3,I love Bridget so much it is awesome the only thing I dislike mildly is lift speed and I know that is hard to change but if you can please Bridger speed up the lifts to make the last run of the day
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2013,3,This is our local hill. It has a lot of difficult terrain with a reasonable amount of easier stuff. Snow is usually pretty good.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2012,4,"This place used to be a local, amazing, very inexpensive gem. One of the best ski areas I've ever been to. Then either they discovered they could get more $$, Bozeman got too big, people discovered it or whatever, the place is now crowded and expensive. Not as expensive as Big Sky or Teton Village, but those are a billionaire/politician freak shows. Too bad, this place was a gem."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,4,"Close to Bozeman, MT and a frequent destination for the locals. The kids love it for snowboarding. A great place for children to learn how to ski."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,4,"Everything was good, except my skiing abilities! Pricier than Great Divide, but everything was nicer too. My kids took skiing lessons there and that was very helpful for them being first time skiiers."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2013,5,"In Alberta there is nothing close to this place. No rocks even though it was late in the year. The snow is soft, not like the man made stuff back home. Not for the novice, a lot of excellent expert runs. We in particular liked renting the avalanche transceivers and skied the back side lift. We did encounter a few sheer cliffs and one avalanche that went through a back run earlier, not for the feint of heart!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2013,4,"Best value in skiing.\nWorld-class mountain with thoughtful, friendly, helpful staff.\nDo not come if you're looking for a resort experience.\nCome if you love skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2013,5,"Visited Bridger Bowl with the intention of taking snowboard lessons during my stay in Bozeman--what a great decision! The prices make skiing/snowboarding accessible even to those on limited budgets, the staff is top-notch, and the lack of lift lines make for an enjoyable on the slopes instead of waiting at the base. There is a variety of terrain and seems to suit all levels from novices up to backcountry skiiers. I worked with Chip, Joe, and Jaime who were all excellent instructors and helped me form a great base of skills and develop confidence in my first few days riding... be warned though, I had such a great experience and developed such a love of winter sports at Bridger that I ended up seeking ski resort employment nearby so I could keep improving on my skills!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2013,2,"For a ski hill its prett lame, especially for montana. There are so many mountains and so much snow. you would think someone would build something to top this"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2013,3,"I've skied Bridger a handful of times over the last 15 years and am never disappointed. Short lift lines, great terrain for all levels of skiers and friendly people. Always love skiing the Cold Smoke. If your in Bozeman set off to ski Big Sky, don't turn your nose up at Bridger. You won't be disappointed and you can't beat the value anywhere."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,5,"Amazing skiing, amazing view! Thanks to Bridger Bowl for such a great experience! The prices were reasonable, terrain well groomed, all facilities were great. Can't wait to go back."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2013,5,"If you are a traveler that needs some hand holding, likes to have a perfectly served hot meal or needs the bus to pick you up when you park 100 yards away, then please go to Big Sky. It's not far. You'll like it better, and I'll like it better. \n\nIf you're looking to go skiing for the snow - please keep reading. To get a feel for Bridger please consider my favorite North American ski areas... Of course Bridger, but also Loveland, Taos (Thank you Ernie), Alta, A Basin... Real skiers (ie - people who really want to ski), steeps to ski, pow that lasts longer than one day, good french fries, and excellent draft beer. I'm not worried about shinny handles, glitzy chairs or the carpeting (although I didn't see any that was frayed). I'm looking for good snow and a safe environment for my kids. And yes, safe can be knowing they're on the Ridge with a beacon and a pack! Why? Because they're surrounded by beacons (more than I've seen at any resort), experience, volunteers, and just simply... a ton genuinely nice people.\n\nMy thanx to everyone on mountain. You're wonderfully professional and fun. Special thanx to Emily and Wanda in Group. You set us up. See everyone later this Spring and again next year with a bigger group!!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2012,4,Our family enjoyed their day at Bridger Bowl. The price was very good and no crowds. The lodge was comfortable and tables to eat our packed lunch.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2013,4,My son is considering Montana State University for college. Having this amazing ski area within 30 minutes from Bozeman is quite enticing. MSU students often have mid-week passes with free transportation and few crowds.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2018,1,"My friend was visiting from Germany. I wanted to show her around Montana. She has never skied before. I went to college at MSU, and recall great experiences and $30 lift ticket prices.\n\nI was excited to give her a great Montana experience. We arrived for half day skiing, purchased our tickets, and got geared up. When we got to the lift line, the power went out and all skiing was closed. Although it is not likely that the power outage was their fault, their subsequent behavior was appalling. I asked for a refund of the ticket as we were completely unable to use the tickets at all. The ticket office people were rude and condescending when approaching them about a refund. I called the office a couple days later to ask if we could return to attempt another visit using our already purchased tickets. Again, the ticket office staff were rude and condescending. Basically elitist pricks. They made it sound like I didn’t belong in Bozeman where everyone apparently has excessive amounts of money to throw around. They made it sound like it was my fault for their power outage. The person on the phone stated that it was my fault “for not arriving earlier in the day”. Unfortunately our itinerary only allowed for a late half day visit. \n\nNot only have they refused to honor our unused tickets but they made themselves sound like rootless cosmopolitans who are too elitist for your average Montanan. \n\nI recommend avoiding this place. Bridger operates on public land leased to them but they don’t act like they respect their privilege to do so.\n\nSave your money and invest in randonee gear and explore the mountains on your own."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2018,4,"When we drove to Bridger from our home in Helena recently, the good experience began in the parking lot. There's a special, close-in, lot reserved for handicap folks and anyone who caarpools (minimum three occupants per vehicle). Excellent! We also saw a city of Bozeman bus taking people to the ski hill. \n\nThe two main lodges are really well designed and maintained. Nice, but not overstated or glitzy. Very clean. \n\nRental shop opened early (!) and the rental experience was very smooth, professional,helpful and efficient. The snowboard, boots and helmet our son rented were new, in excellent condition and of high quality. Ticket window also opened early (!) and the salesclerk was cordial. Ticket price is higher than at our local ski hill back in Helena (Great Divide), but frankly it was worth it. Of course, the $63 lift ticket price at Bridger is far less than the absolutely crazy $154 we would have paid at Big Sky (otherwise known as Big Wallet). \n\nEvery Bridger employee we encountered was courteous and professional. The vibe everywhere was down to earth, pleasant and upbeat. At no time did we encounter rude or pushy people. \n\nThe lifts were good. One odd thing, however. On at least two lifts, they use a weird kind of ""magic carpet"" to move you up to where you get on the chair. We didn't like it, but it wasn't a big deal. But otherwise, the lifts moved along quickly and the lifties were great (they'd call out to us ""What's your favorite Christmas movie?""). \n\nRuns were superb. The green runs were gentle, but varied, and provided relaxed cruising. Blue runs were great fun: challenging enough, but not overdone. Other family members raved about black diamond and double black runs. Grooming was excellent. The variety of skiing/snowboarding terrain was superb. Views (of the Crazy, Gallatin, Bridger and Absaroka ranges) were world-class. Even on a Saturday during Christmas Break, we never experienced crowding on the runs, or long lines at the lifts. Wow. \n\nNever saw a ski patroller on the runs. But then again, had no problems with other skiers/riders, and saw no accidents. \n\nOn the particular day we were there, the afternoon experienced some very high winds. So watch the weather forecast and realize that (at times) high winds can be an issue.\n\nIf I ran Bridger, I would add more signs on the runs. At times, we had to stop and refer to our map to figure out where we were. \n\nWe ate in the cafeteria in the upper lodge. Wish that some people didn't leave their bags lying around. But otherwise, it was a pleasant eating space. Food was better than most ski area cafeterias and somewhat less greasy and fatty (my wife had minnestrone soup and bread) and not as expensive as typical ski area food. \n\nWhen we packed up and left for the day, we all had smiles on our faces. We'll be back."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2018,3,"Went in 1999 and they improved a lot. More things for skiing. New place for beginners separate from the experience skiers. You can bring your dogs, too. Have snow making machines. Ready anytime in winter."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2018,3,"We had the mountain to ourselves on a recent COLD February morning. While the lodge leaves you feeling that it is lacking, the skiing is top notch!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2018,2,Even though the tickets are affordable the crowds have really increased and the kids ski very fast and out of controll\nThere isn't much supervision controlling speed and drinking on the mountain by the skipatrol or the mountain staff.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Nov 2017,3,"For those of whom don't ski they may sit inside, enjoy hot coffee, cocoa and gaze out the huge windows to watch the beauty of dancing slopes of the Bridger Mt's. There are also low-cost lessons for all levels w/ lockers to place all items. It's good to arrive early so you may find a free place to park or take the free shuttle to the slopes. For skiers think cold w/ proper layers of clothing. If one loses their hat, gloves they have lost &amp; found. Enjoy all w/ camera. Great 1st aid station."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2018,4,"We just moved to Bozeman this year. My boys took ski lessons here &amp; we (parents) skied here this winter. Great skiing/snow, usually the lines are not bad at all. Reasonably priced &amp; short distance to get there (from Bozeman). Only a couple ""negative"" things: some Saturdays the road up to Bridger is ridiculous! It took us 1.5 hours to get like 10 miles b/c there were so many cars going up there &amp; some were NOT winter ready, so going off the road, spinning out, etc. It was a mess! The MSU students all go here &amp; again, that makes it a bit more crowded on weekends on the road, not to mention sometimes a little ""rowdy"" on the slopes w/ college kids (drinking, being a bit ""wild"" etc.). Honestly, not a big deal, but my boys commented on that aspect at least a couple times. Otherwise, great place to ski! Lots of terrain &amp; plenty of different levels of runs."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr 2018,5,Spent 2 days skiing at Bridger Bowl with 11 and 13 year old kids. Great time. Wasn’t busy at all so no lines at the lifts. Plenty of snow - conditions were great. Very affordable lift and rental prices made for an enjoyable couple days. We’ll be back.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2017,4,"I like Bridger, it is the low key and less expensive alternative to the resorts at Big Sky. There were no waits for the lifts, and the ski school was great for my 8 year old niece. We are so glad we chose to ski at Bridger over Big Sky. Bridger is a better option for families and new skiers."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2018,4,We are seasoned Big Sky skiers but in recent years have found the prices there to be astronomical and just out of our budget for a family. For 4 people to ski there with 2 kids it costs over $400. Bridger is a GREAT ski area with lots of varied terrain for beginners and experts alike. Every lift is a carpet loader system which is really helpful for beginners. For this level of area I would expect higher rates so this is a rocking deal. $22 for my kids to ski is just so amazing. It's 20ish minutes from town too. Just a note though on busy days get there EARLY or you will be huffing it uphill for a while. There is no shuttle service from the parking lots so once the lots fill up that's it. There is a shuttle from town that I would recommend. It drops you off at the lodge so no walking or worrying about if you're going to get a parking spot. The lodges are really very nice - we usually eat at the mid-mtn one - newly built and a lot of options for food. We love sitting out on the deck if the weather allows and people watching. You really don't want to miss this ski area. Thank you Bridger for keeping your area affordable for the masses. We will be back many times.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2017,5,Bridger Bowl while a local hill is a great place to ski with varied terrain including some very challenging skiing that is accessible by hiking the ride.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2017,4,No cell tower!!! Streamline bus runs shuttle or hitch hike.Locals and college types love this place. I do not ski.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2017,4,Been there many times. It has runs from beginner to expert. It is huge and a lot of fun. Can't go wrong here. It's an easy drive from Bozeman and only two hours from Billings.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2017,4,"You cannot beat this place for value, 1/2 the price of Big Sky and zero pretentiousness, a great family area and close to town."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2017,5,"This is a mountain for every skier. The lower areas are very open and gentle for beginners, middle for intermediates, and all the way to the top of the ridge for true experts. Multiple lifts around open up area so you can ski lots of different runs and levels of terrain. The lodges are all really new and comfortable, fast, easy loading chairs. You load onto the chairs on a magic carpet conveyer belt. Close to Bozeman, 16 miles, so easy trip back when done. A shuttle bus runs from town for free too, so no need to park and carry gear. Tickets are reasonably priced, can book a package through the website and save on the room and tickets and discounted food tickets. They really make it easy and worthwhile to go. Will go back for more!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2017,3,"We had spring skiing conditions and a need for some WAX. No crowds, friendly atmo. Potential for some epic powder skiing above the in area lifts - need avy gear. Price is right, compared to Big Sky"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2017,3,My first visit to Bridger Bowl yielded a fantastic Spring Day. I enjoyed the terrain. Next time I'll be prepared to hike the Ridge.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2017,4,"First time mountain skiing and this location was wonderful. I took advantage of the group lessons (took 3), and two of the days ended up being private lessons because I was the only one in the group. The instructors are amazing, helpful, and fun. The hills have a lot of good variety for all levels, and it isn't so busy that you feel like you will never get on the lift. The people that work there are amazing, and so fun and happy everyday. They sing and dance at the lift, and make you feel like they want to be there. Definitely recommend this ski area."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2017,5,Local here in Montana and Bridger is by far the best resort in the area! Lots of runs for all levels! Had a blast coming here with my family. Definitely a must for both locals and tourists!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2017,3,"We are coming every year here for our family week long ski trip. This is not a huge resort, but there are enough trails for a week, with various levels. The prices are very reasonable, which is important for a family of 4 adults! We rent our skis from the lodge, book our hotel with the reservation center, and all the staff is extremely nice and friendly. Thanks Travis for always helping us! We love Bridger and will come back every year until we can ski for free at 80, right?"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2017,4,I really like this ski resort. Prices are reasonable compared to the size of the mountain they are offering. they have plenty of green and blue routes to offer. it appears to me that the split of routes between green blue and black diamond are equally distributed. I would certainly recommend to any winter sport lovers to come and spend a week here.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2017,5,This place rocks. I wish all the out of staters would stay in Big Sky as this needs to stay small and locals only!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2017,5,Love this place! The snow is great and so is the location. I love being able to drive from Bozeman!!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2017,5,"Bridger received so much snow! Great place to ski ~ Several places to take a break, and get a beer or hot chocolate. Wait times are short!! Just go!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2017,4,"This is a non-profit ski resort!! The skiing is as good as any mountain that I have skied in MT, CO, UT, NV or CA, and at less than half of cost of most. You can afford to bring the whole family. All of the proceeds go back into expansion and improvements. Are yup looking for extreme? The Ridge and Schlushman's are exceptional. If you want challenging blacks, Bridger has them. Do you prefer the groomers or training terrain? There is that in abundance too."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2017,3,"Travelled with my daughter on a spring break trip. Snow and terrain were awesome. We have been coming here for years as a family, best ski area for the money."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2017,3,"The ski area is getting to be much more crowded than it used to be, but is still my top choice in the Bozeman/Big Sky area for a weekday ski. There is a lunch cafeteria at the base and also one on the mountain by the bridger lift with some homemade food options."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2017,4,"We were impressed with this resort, not only were the rates affordable, but a ton of terrain to choose from!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2017,4,"Where I come from... we measure 26 in centimeters... not inches... 26 cm at Revelstoke means get in line at like 6:00 AM. What do you do when it snows 26"" overnight? I still don't know how to comprehend that day....\n\nShout out to Ski patrol who somehow got the whole mountain open at some point in the day. Like.... WOW. AMAZING. \n\nShout out to the locals who were super friendly and in amazing spirits. No one was stealing lines and people were happy to show a fellow powder hound a good time. \n\nShout out to all the lifties and ticket attendants who made the obscene lift lines not matter that much.\n\nKnow this Bridger Bowl... I will be back as I want to test out that crazy looking ridge terrain on a regular old day. I was lucky to get an OBSCENE powder day (the BBC as the locals informed me...) and it was a blast. Your terrain is amazing and up there with the likes of Jackson, Whistler, Snowbird, and my little hometown mountain Revelstoke!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2017,3,"Bridger Bowl is a wonderful local ski area with reasonable rates for skiing and very competent people working in all phases of resort operation. The ski patrol is first class. The snow can be a little variable from year to year, but when it's good it's really good. Unfortunately, it has become too popular so weekends can be a total zoo."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2017,3,Bridger Bowl is a great local ski area. It is not crowded on the week days unless it's a holiday. Great runs for all levels of skiing.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2017,3,"Just 20 minutes from beautiful Bozeman, Montana, Bridger is the perfect area to take the family to ski! No long lines, great instructors, amazing conditions. You cannot beat Bridger for best Return on Vacation Investment!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2017,4,I've been here already two seasons. So one thing that I love about Bridgers is not so many people on regular days. One thing I don't like are slow lifts. Food in all lodges is great. So overall it is nice ski resort. And it doesn't matter if you're skiing alone or with family. Thumbs up Bridgers! \nP.S: but those lifts though...
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2017,5,"This is a truly special ski area. Bridger Bowl is where little kids from Bozeman learn to ski really well, it is a rite of passage for most. A great first time ski vacation for a middle class family. Not a huge dog and pony show full of pomp and jackasses who have flown in from LA with all the best gear they will never use again and an Escalade they can't get into 4 wheel drive. Only a 20 minute drive to a great downtown with excellent restaurants. A family mountain with great ski terrain and local friendlies that will help you get you, your roommates and dependents organized for an epic skiing adventure."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2017,5,"You cannot beat the ticket prices for this place! $57/lift ticket (non-holiday) Skiing is great. Would love to see more blue runs but I think they were limited partly because we went while early ski conditions existed (not as much snow yet). Customer Service is what gave this place my Excellent Rating. They are fantastic! Felt like friends by the time we were done, especially James in the ski shop."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2017,4,"Came back to Bridger Bowl after going to other Montana places for the last 6 years. The upgrades to the north side of the mountain with the 2 lifts and the new lodge was very nice. Free wifi at the alpine lodge was a nice surprise after finding out there is no cell service once you leave Bozeman. Was there during the nfl playoffs so wanted to watch some of the games and needed wifi as there are no tvs that I could find on the mountain. The lines were small, no wait was more than 3 minutes and the loading carpet helped but every lift stopped at least once when riding so guessing there was falling on the unload. Glad I went back, really like it here and will come back again soon."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2016,5,"This ski area is by far one of the best around. It is not nearly as big as Big Sky but this is the place that all the locals hang out. Lift tickets are cheap and usually they are always 100% open all winter. Very impressed with how the ski area invests back into the mountain, in the last couple years they have upgraded numerous lifts and eating areas. That to me is one of the greatest things a ski area can do, the nicer the lifts are the shorter the lines and I can ski more and be less stressed!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,5,"Our large group has rented a condo close to Bridger Bowl a few years in a row now, and we love the place more every time we come back. Great skiing at affordable prices, and something for all levels of expertise. Get a tour of Bridger Bowl on your first day; it's a great way to learn the mountain, runs and lifts by someone that knows them well! (And remember to tip- these are usually volunteers on the mountain doing this). I appreciate the 2 bathrooms/ cafeterias located away from the lodge- you are never too far from food, or a restroom, should you need it. If you get lucky, you'll get some Blue Smoke powder- one of my best days on a mountain, ever!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2017,5,We came to Bozeman to ski Big Sky and after a cold and expensive day there decided to give Bridger Bowl a try. What a little gem this is and we would consider going back. Living where we do we have amazing ski resorts in our backyard but this hill really surprised us. A great family feel to it and very little wait times for the lifts. Plus the lift tickets are half as much as Big Sky.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2017,5,"It's everything you need in a ski resort, without the high prices or the long with lines. They have the double black diamond runs, or they have the basic greens. It's excellent family skiing, and rarely do you see a lift line. And the best part, lift tickets are half the price of other local big resorts."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Aug 2014,4,Climbed a mountain! Summer 2013. A beautiful and great experience. Walking through snow in late July in our sneakers and shorts at 90 something degrees. What a view at the top of Sacajawea!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2014,4,"This is a wonderful ski resort-low key and family oriented- that also has great powder skiing especially if you take time to hike the ridge. If not-lovely groomed hills, nice places to stop and eat, good parking without a long walk with skis. Never a wait in line to get on the lifts!! Good people-great experience. And rentals are at a great price!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2015,4,"Not much better skiing than at Bridger Bowl. For locals such as myself it is affordable and fun for a day trip. Great snow and grooming where needed. Now don't show this review to anyone, it keeps the crowds away."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jun 2015,5,Not overpriced and fun place to ski. Good BEER and good old Montana ladies. Nice lodge and and love the midway lodge.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jun 2015,5,"Great place, lots of friendly locals. Nice staff and great service. Would ski here over Big Sky any day."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2014,4,"Great for a smaller, local ski hill. I prefer Big Sky, but you'll have to shell out a few more to ski there."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2015,4,"Before moving to Montana, I didn't know ski resorts like this existed. Less than 30 minutes from downtown Bozeman, no lines for lifts (ok, sometimes on the busiest of days I have to wait 5 minutes or so), $55 lift tickets, great lessons, rentals and snow conditions. There is skiing for all levels including a bunny slope for beginners and the Ridge which requires an avalanche transceiver. Enjoy great food and sometimes live music, but always drinks after a day skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2015,3,"Bridger is a great mountain that is only about a 15-20 minute drive from downtown Bozeman. Most people probably visit Bozeman from out of state to ski nearby Big Sky Resort, but that's fine with us."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr 2015,3,"Bridger Bowl is only 16 miles from Bozeman making it a playground for winter sports enthusiasts in the area. Excellent expert terrain, less expensive than many ski areas, inexpensive season passes, all lifts have moving carpets for smooth loading. Been skiing/snowboarding there for nearly 30 years now."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2015,4,"Because of Bridger's 2700 ft of vertical, 350+ inches of snow, 2,000 skiable acres and 75 named trails, Bridger is comparable to some of world's best ski resorts. However, due to its renegade nonprofit status and lack of stockholders, Bridger Bowl has been able to eschew typical resort sprawl and reinvest year-end profits back into the mountain for the past half century. The result? Heavenly skiing without the lift lines. One note of caution, there is sometimes a lack of seating in the lodges due to the popularity of Bridger's fries and generous pours of Montucky. Additionally, there are certain areas of the mountain that require an avalanche transceiver to ski - just don't complain about it like the guy in the local favorite YouTube video ""Bridger Bowl Rant"" did, or you will wind up as the opener for all future ski movie premiers."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2016,3,Our first time to Bridger and really enjoyed it. Affordable skiing and a nice variety of terrain. Blessed with fresh snow so had lots of powder to play in but also nice groomers. Staff is friendly too.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,4,We had an excellent time enjoying the good snow conditions and friendly staff. No lift lines. One day we were greated by a host who was offering to go up with us to show us the mountain and the runs. We much prefer to ski Bridger than any Colorado resort. We would highly recommend Bridger for all levels of skiing.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,5,"Make Bridger a must if you are planning to ski in Montana. Great prices, great snow, and nice chalets."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,4,"Having skied much of CO, some Cali, a lot of UT. . . . it was time to experience MT. In the Bozeman area (near) there are 2 spots and the small (non-resort) one is Bridger. We found this little ski area very accommodating with very nice folks. Ticket prices were about 1/2 of the major ""resort"" in the area and it was very convenient of a ""somewhat"" beginner and an experienced skier. It was easy to have a bite and relax and get back to the great runs."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,3,"Fantastic fun for the family! Great runs, friendly and low key, totally uncommercial and anti-resort in nature, with a price point to match."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,3,"Bridger is my favorite place to ski and mostly that is because of the people that work here. Don't get me wrong, the slopes are great. My kids are 8 and 10 and they can go up virtually any chairlift and find their way down without getting into trouble. There is truly something for every level of skier. The ski school is fantastic. We generally get our kids a 90 minute private lesson because we only get out a couple times each year and we have never been disappointed. Patrick is our favorite instructor and my 10 year old daughter requests him every year. There are 4 lodges that serve food and the prices are reasonable and the food is good. The people working on the mountain, whether they are serving food or running the chair lift are fantastic. They are smiling and happy and always have kind words. I have no idea why anyone would spend twice as much to go to Big Sky when Bridger Bowl has so much to offer. It is a short drive from Bozeman which has lots of choices for lodging and food."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,4,"Enjoyed a day skiing here, even with the warm temperatures snow was pretty good. Price was $54 for lift ticket half of Big Sky. Good variety of terrain. Grooming was not as good as Big Sky but with half the price to sky here it was ok. Able to park pretty close to lifts, good bar and restaurant areas."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2016,3,"Good terrain, but slower lifts. Still short lines compared to bigger resorts. Be sure to get some of the famous fries at the mid-mountain lodge. But be forewarned, the serving is not for a single person-- definitely need to share!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2016,4,"Bridger is a great hill! \n\nAffordable prices for a ski area ($54 for adult/$19 for children) &amp; not much waiting at the lift lines. Plenty of varied terrain for all skill levels. \n\nThe other great thing about Bridger is they are a non-profit &amp; not run like a typical ""resort."" There is more information on their website about their ""sustainability mission"" and information on carpooling &amp; the weekend shuttle system. \n\nThe cafeteria style food isn't anything too special, so if you want a healthier (or vegetarian) option, you might consider bringing a lunch. \n\nVery convenient/short drive from Bozeman/Belgrade area. \n\nOverall, we would love to ski there again."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,4,"Great local hill, been there before and got to cash in on my free lift ticket thru the Powder Alliance."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2015,3,"We had a great ski experience at Bridger! The benefits of skiing here outweighed driving to Big Sky \n\nPros: Very economical - young kids free if only asking on bottom of mountain, 20-30 minute drive from Bozeman, easy parking, rental, lift tix, children class sign up, ski school was helpful for our 6 year old and ended up being solo in group class, not crowded, very short lift lines, good slopes, modern lifts.\n\nCons: not as extensive or large as some competitors..., more limited terrain park, some longer flat areas down low.\n\nNeutral: Culinary/ bar options are fine but less extensive than larger competitors"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2015,4,With less than 1 week left before they close for the season all the lifts were open and all the cafés. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Never lines on the lifts and we almost had the mountain to ourselves. We have 10 &amp; 12 year olds and this mountain is perfect for them as well as my husband ( very good skier) and myself ( I stick to blues and short blacks). The trails were groomed both mornings we went. And the price of lift tickets is great; $18 for kids!! If you're looking for a great ski mountain that is a favorite with locals and not pretentious then this is the place. We try to come here every spring. It's only 30 minutes from bozeman.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2015,4,Bridger Bowl is about a half hour from central Bozeman on paved roads. It is a pleasant medium-sized facility with newer structures and services.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2015,5,"We had been to Big Sky at the beginning of our trip and found ourselves with extra time and a desire to ski again, so we checked out Bridger Bowl. We told the staff that the kids had had their first lesson earlier in the week and the kids were placed in lessons based on that information. It turned out that our youngest child was in a lesson that was not at the level where he was. The instructor took the initiative to move him to a class that was better suited to his experience and needs. (Huge praise for taking initiative!) After the class, all 3 of my kids raved about their lesson experience and teachers. My husband had planned to take them skiing the rest of the afternoon but sprained his thumb so he was done for the day. We went back to the office to see about having someone take our kids on some green runs for an hour since we weren't ready to turn them loose (and they weren't ready!) The office staff was very helpful, flexible, and able to accommodate our request. When the kids returned they gushed about their great experience. The guide told me she thought they were ready to ski on their own. Off they went on a few runs until it was time to go! It was a fun and successful day for all! Only drawback: the runs were a bit icy which made me very nervous (I'm not a good skier), but I don't hold that against the the people! Tidbit I learned: A staff person told me that wifi is being installed this summer and should be available next winter. There was no cell service while I was there. I hope we can visit again soon!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2015,3,"Even though I fell and thought my collar bone was broken, I still had fun. The staff really helped out when I fell and got me down the mountain and to the aid station quick. Before my incident, I was having a ton of fun and was blown away by how beautiful it was and how great the powder was!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2015,5,"OK, the snow was marginal but this year having any snow is great. The price is right, only $53. The locals are friendly and quirky and good skiers; you have to be because the inbounds terrain is steep, with interesting terrain features and multiple aspects. Any chairlift that has an avy transceiver checkpoint before you can load has to be access the goods, and it does. And then there is the side country..."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2015,5,"We came from Big Sky to stay a few days in Bozeman and tried out Bridger Bowl. What a treasure - a short and pretty drive to the slopes, no crowds, price is right and great skiing. Wish we lived here and could take advantage of Bridger Bowl more often!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2015,5,"This is a great place to go skiing with challenging terrain, friendly staff and high speed lifts all for a reasonable price! The bowls are fun, the groomers are varied in difficulty and an overall great place to go skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2015,5,"I visited Bridger Bowl with my daughter and grandchildren on Saturday, Feb. 21, 2015. After quite a few days without fresh snow, a recent overnight snow had produced new powder. As a result when I arrived I was horrified by the crowded parking lot. However, those fears were soon vanished. Parking attendants were efficiently directing folks into the lots. Once we got to the Sunnyside lift to gain access to the upper mountain, we only had to wait 9 minutes. Then once on top we had access to Alpine Way, Powder Park, Pierre's Knob lifts and never had another wait in line. I was amazed that on a very, very busy day for Bridger Bowl, how the mountain was easily able to absorb so many skiers. \n\nOur skiing experience was simply fabulous, as we spent the day skiing all over the mountain and taking almost all of the lifts, except the Slachman's lift, which requires avalanche beacons, etc. For lunch we decided to try the new Alpine cabin. What a great view of the mountain while enjoying a great lunch of brats, made from fresh local products. The previous week I had skied at BB and had chile at the Deer Creek Lodge. The BB chile is absolutely the best! (unlike the miserable stuff they now serve down at the Madison Lodge at Moonlight).\n\nThe employees in the food service and lift attendants were very friendly and helpful. And here's the thing about Bridger Bowl---what a FABULOUS VALUE!!! Now that Big Sky has gone big time and charges exorbitant prices, at least compared to what they USED to charge when you had the stand alone Moonlight Basin, Bridger Bowl is SO affordable, with great rates for kids, seniors, and they provide means for buying very economical lift tickets if you don't want to buy a season pass. One such example is the deal where if you purchase a set of ten lift tickets (all day) the price comes out to only $40 per ticket. What a deal considering the great skiing!\n\nOne more thing about BB--that mountain seems to really collect and hold the snow. I skied here a few weeks ago during a time when there had not been any fresh snow for a couple of weeks, and was surprised at how good the conditions were. No rocks, no gravel. Nothing like the conditions you frequently encounter as you ski off the SIx Shooter lift, and ESPECIALLY the Lone Tree lift at Moonlight with the rocks and gravel all over the place. I guess the wind funnels through those spots and does not allow the snow to collect. I still have dents and scratches from an earlier ski at Moonlight. No such problem at Bridger Bowl. \n\nFor this local, I doubt that I will ever return to Big Sky or Moonlight with their current pricing. Why should I when we have such great conditions, runs, food service and GREAT VALUE at Bridger Bowl!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2015,3,"Amazing mountain. Really good terrain for everyone, from beginner flats on the bottom half to the crazy stuff off the schlasman chair. What really made me fall in love with this place and Bozeman in general though is the people. Everyone is super friendly and doesn't hesitate to point you towards the goods.\n\nCan't wait to go back :)"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2018,4,"We normally ski Big Sky but wanted to try Bridger. We will never return. The mountain doesn’t offer many runs or lifts, and the lines were very long on a Sunday afternoon. We had to use a tow rope (yes, the kind I used 40 years ago when I learned to ski) to get back from one area of the hill to the lift. It’s not easy. At 3:30- they close at 4:00- we wanted to stop for a beer. Alas, the restaurant was closed and no drinks were being sold any longer. No joke. Also, when we arrived for the day, we wanted to buy half day tickets and be ready to ski at the lift at 12:30. But they won’t sell the tickets early. So we all had to stand around at the ticket counters and wait in lines rather than them letting us buy the tickets early. There were about 20 people wanting to buy tickets. To make it even more humiliating, they blast the squeaking from a plastic toy chicken into their microphone when it was 12:30-ostensibly to let us know that now they would be so kind as to sell all of us tickets. It’s a nonsensical approach to wait until 12:30 and also to treat your customers so poorly. Don’t ski Bridger. Go to Big Sky where the skiing is always amazing, more runs than you can ski in a day, and the employees treat customers well. We will never return to Bridger."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2018,3,"We experienced one of the greatest snow days on our recent vaction. The lodge is very comfortable, the food was exellent and the sking was fantastic. We were there midweek and there was little to no waiting on the lifts. There are many diverse runs and excellent lifts. Looking forward to going there again."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2018,3,"I was told Bridger Bowl was a good mountain to ski, so I checked it out. It was pleasant. I went in the week, so it wasn't busy. There were no lines to the chairlift. I got quite a few runs in. There are some challenging trails there. It is a moderate sized mountain and not small by any means. The price of a lift ticket for the day is definitely worth it."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2018,4,"Smartly run local ski area with lots of vertical and terrain variety from family friendly to extreme. Lodges are very clean, well-designed and inviting. Definitely, a must if you are a skier and find yourself in Bozeman."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2018,4,"We have skied Bridger Mt. several times over the years and really lucked out on the snow this time! One day there was 19"" of fresh light (4-5% moisture) snow which was WONDERFUL to ski through--way less work that heavier powder we thought was good at home. As far as we could tell, there is almost no cell service there and in the canyon road area, at least with Verizon. We had spotty ""live"" spots, especially at the top of the higher lifts. The lowest lodge had useless wi-fi, but the Jim Bridger lodge had OK wi-fi. (Don't know about the other lodges). The weekend crowd made it almost impossible to get a table in the eating areas, but Monday was no problem, even at 12:30. Two days the wind was gusting so strong during the night and morning we hesitated to drive up from our rented house halfway from Bozeman (not a bad drive) but it abated on the mountain and we had good skiing. They have plenty of snow for good coverage, too. We took advantage of the Ski Alliance agreement with our home area season-pass so only had to buy Saturday tickets for our 4-days of skiing! It's just 20 miles or so from downtown Bozeman which has a fun quaint downtown, lots of hotels, restaurants, etc."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Sep 2017,5,Great snow in the winter and beautiful hikes in the summer. you can't beat the views and experience at Bridger
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2018,4,"Bridger Bowl is easy driving distance from Bozeman hotels at I-90 and 7th Street. The road is not difficult, even if it's snowing. The parking is free but does not have a parking lot shuttle. The food is much less expensive than at the other resort outside of Bozeman. Also the lift tickets are only $60.00 for the day, verses $140 down at Big Sky. The lifts have conveyors to assist loading, but are not high speed. Terrain is a little short on beginner runs, but lot's of options for experienced and expert skiers. This was my 2nd visit and I would certainly return for the good skiing and great value."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2018,3,"Loved skiing Bridger Bowl! Lots of easy trails but once you get above them, there’s lots of fun variety. Alpine lift gets you up into some gorgeous runs that smell like Christmas trees. Pierre’s Knob has some pretty fast/steep runs. The lodges are clean &amp; well-maintained; food is perfectly reasonable."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2018,5,"My wife and I are true ski bums...both retired and ski over 100 days each year throughout North America. In fact have skied about 40 of the top 50 resorts. We found Bridger to be a delightful ski experience and thoroughly enjoyed the day!! It has a beautiful setting, first rate infrastructure and fun terrain. Would certainly recommend this mountain. The only slight issue is the variety of terrain. Some of that was attributable to early season conditions which limited some of the expert areas. Overall this is a wonderful ski experience."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2017,5,"We hit Bridger Bowl on the first Monday it opened this season and really enjoyed our time there. It was our first visit and we loved how it did not feel like a big commercial ski resort and had more of that friendly, local vibe. Prices were very reasonable and the facilities were great. We knew being early in the season the base wasn't the best, but we still had a lot of fun and enjoyed the beautiful surroundings. We are looking forward to returning sometime in the near future."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2015,4,Decent skiing just outside Bozeman with reasonable lift rates. Food is low standard cafeteria fare. Free parking. Can't compare to world class skiing at Big Sky about an hour south of Bozeman.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2015,5,"It is real. It has incredible terrain for black diamond skiers as well as plenty of groomers. People are considerate. It is the antithesis to the dress-to-the-nines places. If you want a true ski experience, this is for you."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr 2015,5,Bridger Bowl is an affordable place for skiers and families. We took our young grandchildren for introductory skiing lessons. The instructors were fabulous. The kids were able to show considerable progress within 3 lessons. It was very affordable. Accessible from Bozeman.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2015,5,"This is a great community ski area. The kids programs made my kids into crazy expert skiers. The ""ski PE"" program is fabulous for MSU students at all levels. It is not a great destination resort: no on-hill lodging, iffy dining, no high speed lifts, but it is a great hill for a small price. The advanced terrain is world class - nice intermediate and beginner terrain but with slow lifts it is nothing special. It is however relatively inexpensive. I have had a season pass there for 28 seasons and I love it, but I live here and the convenience rules."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2015,4,"We've been skiing Bridger Bowl for 15 years, since the kids were in backpacks. Now we ski all the terrain with them. It's a big playground, not as many acres as Big Sky but has numerous little tree areas that really are fun. Hiking the Ridge is amazing, the beauty and feeling of being on top of the mountains is well worth the price of admission.\nAlso hiking in the summer is really fun and beautiful too, especially if you time it right and see the wild flowers."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jun 2015,3,"If you want to ski or just get in touch with nature then this is the place for you. If, like me, you have hard, icy snow in your country then Brider Bowl has lots of soft, fluffy snow. There are easy, hard and bumpy runs, each with a spectacular view from the top. You must ski the bowl some time. In summer, an equally nice place to visit. The drive up to Bridger is part of the fun going under stone arches and passing rivers and ranches on the way."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr 2015,4,"It's a relatively small mountain, but it has some very intense steeps, especially off the top. When there is plenty of snow, and if you are willing to do some walking/climbing, there are dozens if not hundreds of lines between the trees and rocks that range from wicked to hair-raising.\nThe terrain down below is a lot more tame.\nThis is a bit of an old-school resort in that it doesn't have a lot of new, fancy equipment and the window-dressings of more affluent resorts.\nSome lifts require you to have your avalanche beacon and shovel. They check every time, so be prepared."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2015,4,"Awesome ski area, still affordable. Not too many bells or whistles, just the things you need. If you want access to the entire ski area bring your avalanche beacon and be prepared to do some hiking. If you know what you are doing, head for the ridge. If not, and you just wanna have some fun, head for hully gully."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2014,4,Bozeman had the best skiing in the world. There are no lines and there is enough hill to occupy all levels. The food and beer is great...best place to teach a child...low priced and excellent lessons! Taught my kids here at age three...The instructors taught me as well as the kids so I could continue to developing skiers after the lessons.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2014,4,"wonderful local ski hill, with a down home feel. Great terrain and way better snow than Big Sky. fun!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2016,5,"Visit every spring for March/Spring break skiing. Friendly staff welcomes skiers of all ages. Equipment rentals, lessons, chair lift all super affordable. Trails for all levels well maintained. Locals on the mountain super friendly and helpful. A gem!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2016,5,"Bridger Bowl is the only non-profit ski area in the US and prides itself on being a family focused hill. We ski there most weekends and enjoy the safe, family-friendly vibe along with pristine powder for all ability levels."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2016,4,"Love Bridger Bowl. It is how I remember skiing when I was young. Casual, not over crowded, friendly staff, affordable ticket prices. It also is so close, that it is perfect for a couple hours of skiing without committing an entire day. I do wish there was more intermediate terrain. You are limited to the lower 2/3 of the mountain unless you are an expert skier and want to ski off the ridge line. Most born and raised Bozemanites are expert skiers having grown up on this mountain. But the rest of us..."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2016,4,"Twenty minutes out of town, manageable lines wonderful services. Variety of runs for all level of skier and snowboarder."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jul 2016,3,"Was in the area visiting friends. They brought us up to Bridger Bowl to see where their kids ski in the winter. Even in the summer, the area is breathtaking..."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2016,3,"Close, great terrain, cheap, and fun. When there is snow its one of my favorite mountains to ride. Its a must experience for sure."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2016,4,"As a Bozeman resident, I prefer to ski here vs. Big Sky. I love the small town feel and locals only vibe but it's not a mean locals only vibe. If you fall, someone almost always stops and asks if you are ok or need help. Just a great place to take your kids skiing and to enjoy Montana skiing without all the movie star hubbub of Big Sky. Oh and great ski runs too. ;)"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jun 2016,4,"I love Bridger. I learn how to ski there 14 years ago\nFriendly people, a always willing to help. Very affordable!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Nov 2015,3,We bought a season pass and loved that we could go up easily on any week day and park a short walk from the ski slopes. I had an accident on the last day of the season and they took great care of me too!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,4,"After 20 years of visiting Bridger Bowl I have never had a bad experience! Great staff, great prices, great skiing, great food! The atmosphere is so refreshing and comfortable. Someday I hope to bring my children."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2015,5,"We got midweek passes this year and cold not be happier. It is only 20 minutes from downtown bozeman when the roads are clear. there are no lines on the week days, parking is easy and the runs are fast and fun. the lifts are a little slow but no one cares since it is so close to home and easy to get to."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2016,4,Because there is no on hill lodging it depends on locals. Food and ski chalets are plentiful. But when it snows forget it all the college students cut class and head for the slopes and the place is packed.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2015,4,"My family of 4 skied Bridger Bowl over Christmas and found the hill to be really nice. We arrived and made use of the quite large 15 minute dropoff area to save the whining from the kids until later. Lift tickets were extremely reasonably priced and were a relief from nearby overpriced ski areas. Once we were on the hill, the kids had a blast. my 7 and 10 year olds easily navigated the blue runs and the lift operators were exceptionally helpful about reminding my kids what to do. We thought that the ""magic carpet-like"" lift areas were really neat and saved on botched loads. A great improvement to the hill! Our only complaint was the weather which certainly isn't anything that can be controlled. It was a very windy day which meant frequent trips indoors. The hot chocolate was good, meals were reasonably priced and bathrooms were clean. All in all a great day!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2016,4,"We were attracted to Bridger for its impressive track record on sustainability and environmental friendliness. The prices are reasonable because Bridger is a co-op, and do not reflect in any way a lower quality slope. Fantastic variety of slopes from the easiest to most extreme. Fantastic instructors! If you go to ski for food, fashion and off-slope entertainment this is not your place. Make sure to take a trail map. as the trails are not marked in great detail. There is however a nice well marked ""easiest route down"" for those who need it. An excellent experience for very young children, (pre-K)."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2015,5,"Nice ski area w/plenty of varied terrain. Holds snow pretty good after a dump, Has everything from super easy to super hard. Cold. Uphill from parking, Decent prices on beer/drinks/some food Friendly staff"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2015,4,"I thought this was going to be a podunk backyard little ski area, it turned out to be an excellent area to visit, it had that small town family atmosphere with the attitude to go along with it, the more ski areas I visit the more I appreciate the family attitude. The mountain is expansive and terrain vast and challenging. They received 17 inches of fine powder the two days we skied there so there was plenty of POW to go around. I was disappointed that I was not able to ride the Schlasman lift, my Son did not want to ride it and I did not feel comfortable going alone as avalanche transceivers (457 khz) are required - Bridger should find a way to get at least one run open on the Schlasman lift where a avalanche transceiver (457 khz) is not required, although after seeing the Ridge Terrain, I totally understand their position."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2015,3,"Can't beat the price for kids, only $19. Decent variety of runs. .. Doesn't have some of the amenities of larger ski resorts. ..ie: some of the lifts seemed dated and slow, not many foot rests, runs not well labeled... However the snow was fantastic, we never waited in line (and it is a holiday week), and our ski instructor seemed to like his job! Eat early on the mountain if you are going to, they close must of those 2ish..then your only option is the bar in the lodge ..oh and they have a parking lot close in for cars with more than 3 occupants, take the closer parking families! overall we enjoyed the value AND beauty of this resort."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2015,3,"We loved Bridger! While it is ""smaller"" (fewer lifts, runs) than other mega-resorts, it is more than big enough to be enjoyable for all levels of skiers on a multi-day ski vacation. Lift prices (especially for kids) are unbeatable! We didn't encounter any lines/crowds and the snow was spectacular! Varied terrain - wide open spaces and trees and everything in between. We didn't cover any of the extreme terrain, but it was fun to watch from the lifts as other skiers tackled the ""scary stuff"". We will return!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2015,4,"My family hasn't ever skied before so we signed up for a family lesson - it was an hour and a half long, and reasonably priced. The instructor (Mariah) was great and worked with each of us at our own level. The place is well run and we had a blast! Thanks Mariah\n\nRyan, Alicia, Ali, and Josiah"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2015,3,"This is the best skiing in Montana, even the ""world famous"" Big Sky does not stand a chance against bridger bowl, this is the place to ski, with very reasonable lift prices, skiing for all skill levels, and pretty good food."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2016,4,"It's just a short drive from Bozeman and it has the best snow. This is a local favorite and once you go you will know why. Other ski areas get more hype but if you are looking for a true ski experience, this is the place. Its the real deal."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,5,This is one of the original ski areas in Montana that has typically had excellent snow coverage and usually early in the ski season. It's terrain is also very family friendly and yet offers challenging slopes for those that want to push the limit.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2015,5,I personally have never ben there .my daughter goes there often and says it is a great place to ski.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr 2016,3,"Nice quiet slope. No high speed quads, but nice place close to Bozeman to board with the locals. Has some awesome snow and really nice runs. Combined with the cheap lift tickets it's hard to beat!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2016,4,"While not exactly a ski ""resort"", Bridger Bowl offers a great ski/snowboard experience for all levels. Most visitors will stay in Bozeman, but there are limited accommodations near the mountain. Scenery is exceptional as is the snow quality and employees. Don't miss Jimmy B's or the Grizzly!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,4,"After moving to Bozeman from Park City, Utah I was quite surprised and pleased with this ski resort."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2016,4,Bridger Bowl has so many options of trails for any level of skier. They are so family friendly! Bring your lunches or coolers! Tickets are very reasonably priced
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2016,4,"We lucked out with a bout of cold weather and a modest snow fall on a Spring break Wednesday.\nThe bottom of the hill is pretty shallow, so there are quite a few spots that require poling or kicking to keep going.\nThe Boy goes to MSU and has a season pass. Bridger Bowl folks are really easy to work with. He's had good experience with the office folks and we were all happy with the on-site rental shop. There is another rental outfit right off the parking area that The Boy waved us away from. Don't know why. My rental skis were quite sticky and they cheerfully waxed them on request.\nAll the staff around the resort were really nice and seemed to be tickled with their jobs.\nThe on-site food options were surprisingly un-exorbitant. Typical fare."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2016,4,"Spent two afternoons here, learning to ski. Great scenery, helpful people in the rental shop. I'm told the powder early in the day was excellent. My five afternoon runs were great!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2016,4,"I wish I lived closer to this great resort! This was my fourth visit, and I love the setting, the runs (although I stick to the easier trails), and the great value with reasonable lift ticket prices. The food in the lodges isn't anything to write home about, but then, I don't go there for fine dining."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2019,4,"If you are an extreme skier, this is your place. The hike to terrain is just unreal. But of course that was way over our heads.\n\nWe are older skiers who prefer steep groomed runs. That is something lacking here. They have great intermediate runs and some very good beginner runs but nothing in between Oh my god and flat runs.\n\nThe lifts and facilities are first rate. The mid mountain restaurant is great."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2019,5,Took my family skiing last weekend and it was gorgeous! Next to no one on the lower part of the hill and groomed runs with slight powder covering made for a great day to teach my kiddo how to ski!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2019,4,"No fooling around here. Plenty of snow and powder. No condos,outrageous prices,heated chairs, villages with Jewlers and furriers etc. if you are looking for a Vail,chamonix or whistler head up the road. This family oriented and BIG time steeps,bumps,woods and nice people. The ridge andSchlussmans lift are hike up areas for which you need avelanche beacons. The rest of the area none. Enough gentle terrain as well. Certified ski school. Kids programs for locals every weekend. Also town races. Ski rentals and repairs very nice people too The way it used to be. Come join the fun but I am not telling you where my powder stash is."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2018,3,"The place is simply amazing, the mountains and the trails are awesome! We had a big group from beginners to advanced and everyone had a blast ! My soon joined the ski school and he got much more confident. We had some issues with our skis , and even being our personal equipment the crew was amazing to support and make out experience delightful and unforgettable! We can’t wait to be back !!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2019,5,Im an upper intermediate skier. The slopes are great. Enough black diamond runs to chose from There is a terrain park for those who want as well. Friendly atmosphere. there is an upper and lower mountain meal lodge. Been going for years. No lineup at lifts. A gem of a find.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2019,4,"Great skiing and riding located just outside Bozeman, MT. The mountain has a lot to offer with a good deal of varying terrain. The lift system is well laid out and seems to accommodate the crowd well. The lodging areas offer the necessities without the frills of larger resorts. Lift tickets are reasonably priced."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2019,3,"A smaller ski destination however PLENTY of skiing terrain from back-country/beacon-required ridges to nicely novice; no-pretense; no-glitz; affordable (compared to Big Sky); rarely lift-lines. A community-serving non-profit. Excellent ski school and competent rescue (required, alas, when a companion concussed on hard-pack.... it's why one wears a helmet, right?). The BEST!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2019,3,"Bridger Bowl is amazing! It was runs for all levels, and lots of them, you couldn't get bored. Much more reasonable pricing than Big Sky or other more famous ski areas. And the conveyor belts under the chair lifts are fabulous, more ski fields should utilise them."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2018,5,"My group of 4 adults thoroughly enjoyed Bridger Bowl! Two in our group had never seen snow or been skiing before and the lessons at Bridger really helped them out! My husband and I did lessons on the green slopes with an instructor who really helped teach us some additional tricks and build our confidence on the slopes, we hadn’t been skiing for a couple years. Bridger was amazing! There are a lot of runs and there weren’t big lines or crowds for the lifts! Very affordable price for the three day pass. Hope to be back soon!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Dec 2018,3,I typically ski in the Tahoe basin - i.e. sierra cement - and it was nice to finally experience some cold smoke!! This is a very nice resort with terrain that will please everyone! We were there over the Christmas holiday and even then we never waited more than a minute or two to get on the lift. Easy parking - and if you carpool it's even better. If you are in the area and looking to ski/snowboard this is a must!!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,3,Most people are drawn to Bozeman to ski Big Sky. Take a day to ski the local hill and always check for the flashing light on the Baxter Hotel. Calling locals to great skiing. Bridger is half the cost and a great experience.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,5,I was in Bozeman for a week of work and took a day to get some runs in at Bridger. This is a great place for sking. It has runs and lifts for all abilities. Definitely enough to keep you busy all day. I skied the groomed slopes and there were Plenty of blue and a few blacks. \nPlus with it being half the price of Big Sky and a lot closer it was perfect if you only have one day.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,5,This is a relatively small ski area about 15 miles from Bozeman. Ski lift tickets are $53 per day and there are at least two ski rental shops at the mountain. I have always visited and skied during the week and have never had a lift line! But I suspect the weekends are busy. Several restaurants on the mountain with warming houses. Great place!! Friendly staff.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,5,Ski here the most out of any other ski resort and love it! I would think it would be very neat if they did night skiing. I love the lodges my favorite is the deer park chalet. Jimmy b's in Jim bridger lodge has the Best food. All the lodges have the best fries me and my friends always look forward to eating them.-
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2016,3,"This area is great to use. Don't expect high speed quads but enjoy the way skiing is meant to be enjoyed. Great variety of slopes, something for everyone."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2016,5,"We love snowboarding in Montana. The mountains are less crowded then other states and usually much cheaper. We've been boarding for over ten years so we've been all over the US\n\nTypically we do Whitefish (love it there!) but decided to switch it up this year. Glad we did! It was a nice variety. \n\nI have zero complaints. It wasn't packed. We got lucky with awesome snow fall. Restaurants in the area were great. Locals were nice and helpful. \n\nWe decided to go here instead of Big Sky because of price and the fact we hate sharing the mountain with tourists. Even if we are one ourselves.\n\nDon't regret that decision, the mountain was more then what we needed!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2016,5,"Went here on a Sat and the place was absolutely packed. Do yourself a favor. If you're here to ski/snowboard, just spend the extra cash and time to visit Big Sky."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2016,4,"Good place for the traveller who wants to go snow skiing, but has to hire ski gear. Hire rates and lift ticket costs are much lower than other areas. Whilst I only went there once, I was pleasantly surprised with the friendliness of the other skiers. It is well patronised by the local community which leads to the community feel of the place."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2016,5,"Having alpine skied all over the world I was wowed by Bridger. Not huge by those standards, but Bridger has everything to offer from fanatical steeps to easy cruisers, and the friendliest of people. Bridger is considered a college ski area but that should not deter any visitor and lift ticket prices are very reasonable."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jan 2016,5,"A perfect day of skiing at the best""town"" ski area in America.\nFrom the new lifts to the hike and ski ridge terrain, Bridger has it all.\nA mountain tour from Ric C. An instructor in the world renown Snow Sports school, made a perfect way to acquaint us the the old Bridger that we knew from the 90's.\nWow, awesome progress that exceeded expectations.\nThe new Alpine on mountain warmup hut is really cool.\nAwesome views and great vintage pictures throughout the building, make a hot chocolate stop an adventure on its own.\nThis should be a must do for any skier who is old enough to remember ""Cubco"" bindings."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2014,5,"Love the friendly atmosphere, great snow, nice layout! I'm a lifelong skier and enjoy skiing different areas around the world. Bridger is a gem. Friendly locals -- look for the singing liftop! He's dancing and having a great time. Makes the day really fun when you have an employee enjoying himself and getting everyone involved. Varied terrain. Plenty of beginner runs for learning, great hike-to chutes and steeps. I spent the day hiking and skiing chutes in 2' of snow from earlier in the week. Snow was great and we found several untracked runs to enjoy. It was fun to see the MSU math department skiing together!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Sep 2014,4,"But this is a beautiful place to visit even in the off season. Leaves are changing and there was snow this week (but it melted), still this long time bowl is as popular as ever."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr 2014,4,"Bridger Bowl is a great place to ski/snow board if you like friendly staff, good service and reasonable prices (lift tickets, food, lessons). 2013-2014 was an outstanding snow year and hopefully 2014-2015 will be too. Come and enjoy the great terrain, snow and fun."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Jun 2014,4,"Magnifent snow dotted mountains in June, tall green grass with variety of evergreen trees, creeks rushing with fresh snow melt, antelope, deer and eagles observed along the way, and a gorgeous colorful sunset late in the evening. Drive well worth taking to feel just a little bit more alive!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2014,5,"Love this local area, lots of hard terrain and fantastic snow, fewer crowds, great views. Sometimes they open late due to avalanche control and parking is awful, but it's worth it!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2014,4,"It had good snow when we visited, but it reminded me of an eastern resort. It certainly was not at all like the massive, steep and deep Big Sky Resort close by."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr 2014,4,"Bridger Bowl continues to offer, like everything else in Bozeman, serious, authentic, and challenging experiences and recreation without attitude. The mountain skews intermediate to advanced on terrain, but better access to beginner/intermediate mix came in the 2013/2014 year. This is NOT a resort, but a true local ski area that also offers significant advanced terrain and side-country options."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2014,5,Loved this place - great slopes for all different levels of skiers - from black diamond son to green-slope mamma (me) - we all enjoyed our day!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2014,4,"BB w/ it's new Schlasmans lift (or however you spell it) is the real deal. This resort is a powder pigs delight and if you like to hike, you're in heaven. Hit up a local to show you around the mtn. Real friendly &amp; kind folk for the most part."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2014,4,"Great skiing, great ski instructors, great equipment rental...oh and fabulous FRIES! Bridger is not just for the locals, this hidden gem is close to Downtown Bozeman - 25 minute drive and daily tickets cost less than the other ski resorts near by."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Apr 2014,4,"Still owned by the community, new lifts this year for lower ability skiing people. While, the ridge terrain is some of the most extreme lift served anywhere. Only $50 for a ticket such a deal."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2014,4,"A caution: No toilet facilities are at the sign-in cabin. So use the ones by the parking lot. A caution: Take the correct skis for the weather. (Otherwise, rent a pair.) The ice was slippery the day we went, so waxed skis were unsafe."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2014,5,"We were recently here for a YSL ski championship race. The lift tickets are reasonable (esp. when compared to neighboring Big Sky!). We find the Virginia City lift super annoying, but once you get beyond that, there are plenty of high-speed lifts and lots of good terrain. Snow was great and there is certainly plenty of terrain no matter what your level. Really enjoyed our time here."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2014,5,Our family vacation is to Bridger Bowl.\nThe staff is always friendly and the mountain is just awesome.\nI have skied many different mountains and I just Love this place.\nIt holds the snow great and what that means is it doesn't get wind swept like other mountains. \nThey have the best lift prices and a mom and pop feel to the place. Great for families with easy to extreme terrain.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Mar 2014,5,Over a year ago I rated Moonlight Basin as a superior value. That has now changed. This year Bridger Bowl installed two new chair lifts (Alpine and Powder Park) that provide better access to some really nice terrain--especially for skiing fresh powder and skiing through trees.\n\nMoonlight merged with Big Sky and is now very expensive--twice as much as Bridger. I will be staying close to home and skiing Bridger Bowl.\n\nThe main recommendation I would offer is to go early to get a decent parking space and to enjoy the uncrowded slopes.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2014,3,"Very nice terrain, helpful staff. Need to get there early to avoid a long walk from the parking lot. Wish they had shuttle service from Bozeman on weekdays."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2014,4,"Very friendly, helpful staff. Reasonably priced with the Powderhound deal. Good variety of runs for an intermediate skier over our four day stay. No crowds."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2014,5,A great place after a nice snowfall. The Ridge Terrain is fantastic and offers fresh lines a couple of days after a big snow (beacon required.) Bridger Bowl felt a lot like the club fields in New Zealand without all the pretentiousness and gouging of larger resorts ($51 daily lift tickets!) It is a ski area designed for people that are more interested in skiing rather than prancing around the bar in the lodge showing off new ski clothes. Check the temperature forecast as it can get COLD! Real cold.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2014,4,Loved skiing here. Had a couple of great powder days with the lightest drier powder I have ever seen. Went to Big Sky for a day but ended up coming back to Bridger because we liked it so much!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,Feb 2014,5,"For about $50 (adults) and almost nothing ($17) for kids, it's hard to beat Bridger. Food prices were also cheap and the staff was very friendly."
