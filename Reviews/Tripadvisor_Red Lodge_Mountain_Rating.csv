Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2012,4,"This is where I ski nearly 100% of the time. RLM doesn't have the super gnarly runs that Jackson Hole or Big Sky have but it still has a wide variety of terrain that will satisfy just about anyone and also doesn't cost an outrageous amount for a lift ticket. The food is better than average and not as expensive as other pricier ski areas. The staff is always friendly and helpful, especially the Mountain Hosts who help get your kids to ski school, help unload your vehicle and even carry bags and skis for you. This is a good place for families and the ski school does an excellent job with kids. The only real downside is that there are no lodging facilities at the mountain but the town of Red Lodge is only 6 miles away and there are several motels and good restaurants in town."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,,5,"I was a first time visitor Jan. 15-18, 2012. It will not be my last. \n\nMy son and I took our ski vacation this year and decided on Red Lodge Montain Resort as our destination because Red Lodge had the most significant amount of snow year to date. Great choice on our part even though we drove 770 miles from Sioux Falls, SD. For me as long as Red Lodge has the snow I will gladly make it an annual trek. \n\nThe staff at the resort were fantastic, everyone from ticket sales to lift ops were friendly and helpful. \n\nThe ski chow was great and not overpriced. This was truly a mom and pop, old fashioned down to resort. \n\nAs an intermediate skier, the terrain was all I could ask for, the variety of runs was awsom. My son (a ski instructor), was more than content with the variety of terrain. \n\nThe snow, dry fluffy powder, wow!!\n\nI'll be back..."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2012,4,"We went to RLM because they had the most snow of all the Montana ski hills within 1 days drive of our home in Alberta Canada. We appreciated getting discounted lift tickets at our B&amp;B and the fact that there were no crowds and 14"" of fresh powder"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,,4,This is one of the most gorgeous drives in Montana. The views are amazing! A must see!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2011,5,"We drove out from Minneapolis over the Christmas week 2011. \n\nThis place has a monster rise off the local terrain. We had stopped in Billings on the way out to buy discount lift tickets - adults at $42 rather than $49, (college kids get them for $32 at the hill), and could see not only the hill but the runs from the edge of Billings - 50 miles away. The town of Red Lodge is at 5500 ft, the plains below probably at 4000 ft or less, so the view from the top was huge. You could see the Crazy mountains and I'm quite sure the Bridger range to the west. Behind were the peaks and high plateau of the bear tooth range - spectaular. The ski hill peaks are at 9700, chalet base is 7700, but the palisade area drops another 400' for the advertised 2400' vert. But the impressive part is it's 2000 ft straight down. Two main runs run from top to bottom, one is black diamond (upper and lower limited), the other intermediate (lazy M) (but in the midwest it would also be black diamond). All of us went down Lazy M, but it isn't lazy. You wouldn't be able to bomb it - and the limited, which is groomed - would get you up around a hundred if you tucked and kept your feet. That run, if left ungroomed would be a 2 mile mogul run all the way down. Even the beginner lift, Miami beach, has a grade like an intermediate run and is tilted to the fall line, so isn't the best for beginners, but is a full 300 ft in elevation. Our daughters spent much time on that run. The only true beginner area is right out front the chalet in the wide ravine though which all the runs eventually funnel to the main lower lift. The Miami beach area is in it's own side ravine. The main area has a long magic carpet off the north side and a roped area for beginners and lessons. Good area for true beginners. It was packed. \n \nFive days before we arrived they got 2 feet of snow. Three days before our arrival temps got up into the 40s. We saw little powder, almost all hard packed power, and a touch of the hard stuff. Conditions were actually very good and what we like to ski, but I was surprised it settled and got knocked down so fast. This hill was completely open, base of 4' +, nothing else in the West as far as I know was even 75% open at this time, so folks normally running off to Big Sky for the day or Bridger were here. The parking lot is small for ski area size and cars were parked on the side of the access road going a full mile down the road. My wife had an old guy sit with her for a while and said normally the top lot is only half full. Yet in spite of having record crowds, and mostly older lifts, there were no real lift lines. Even on day 2 when they closed the upper lifts due to wind, my son and I took the willow lift multiple times - no lines. An exception to this was the Miami beach lift which ran at a snails pace had a long line and the high speed quad in the palisades area had a bit of a line. The main triple lift flies along, they have a sign in front telling you you'll get knocked on your can if you don't pay attention. \n \nMy son and I skied much on the front side and Latigo in the Cole Creek area. Again very steep grade for an intermediate run. His gps showed a 1000+ ft drop in about a mile. I skied true grit (double black) once - steep with mostly shallow bumps..And of course there was a family of 4 going down it - mom, dad, sister and little sister - about age 5. Not sure what their motivation was - at their rate they were going to get just one run in. Our second time down this area we took the trail that goes to the bottom of the palisades. My son said it was the best trail he's ever been on. Dangerous weaving thing, hard to keep the speed down. Other great mogul runs were Berrys, Thompsons' and Royals run. Even on the lower level of the hill off the side of the main ridge, they had runs like Bigfoot and Bear paw that longer bump runs than most in the Midwest. \n \nBest part of the hill is the terrain, from looking at google earth and the tail map, I underestimated the size and topography. It's much larger, steeper, and varied than I expected. Ridges, valleys and heavily treed. Much more interesting terrain than Solitude and Winter Park, and from what I remember of Keystone and A-basin. Similar but obviously smaller, yet more challenging than Snowmass. The Drainage area looked cool from the chair but not like the map... it's just tree skiing in a really steep gorge. I didn't try it. \n \nShort comings? Lower parking is 50 ft below upper parking. Upper parking is 20 ft below the chalet. Step out of the undersized Chalet, and you have to walk up 12 ft of hill to get to either of the lift lines. Had they not flattened out the area for the parking, they could have continued the runs down another 500 feet into the ravine. They're short of flat areas. Instead of fanning out onto flats, it all funnels in to a congested, overly steep area. I didn't mind, nor did our kids, but not an easy place for beginners. The upper chalet was very nice. Day 2 we stopped in early - almost empty. Next we stopped at noon, jam packed, but again the weather went from calm, sunny and 35 in the morning to maybe 40 mph gusts midday. \n \nThe entire area is in a national forest with limited base facilities for the size of the hill. Sort of like Lutsen on a busy day. They did put in 2 high speed quads in sometime ago - for Cole creek and Palisades, but in my opinion they should have used the Palisade quad (not always in use) and used it to serve the base area, and moved dirt around to make base area more friendly. Also there is no on site lodging so it's a ski hill - not a resort. I imagine the locals would want it to stay the way forever. Limited older lodging in town, inconvenient for beginners, no glamour. In return they get great cheap skiing. I'd go back for another look. Can't say the same for three of the other places I've been to in the last few years."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2011,5,Best value on front range. Large enough resort and amazing prices. The only deficiency are the slow lifts but that is definitely covered in reasonable prices.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Oct 2011,3,cool town with good eating places and very nice shops to buy things
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,,3,"Had a great time here with family, nice terrain park, plenty of trails, did I mention student discount. Great front desk service. Rentals were a little in bad shape but I seen worst. Overall Great."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,,3,"This mountain was great, pure Montana powder for a cheaper price than I pay to go out on the ice in Pennsylvania. Plenty of great runs from all ranges, beginner to expert. \n\nOnly issue I had was no lap bars on the lifts, that was kind of freaky. Still, this is an amazing small mountain to ski at. Highly recommended."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jun 2020,3,"Took a ride up the mountain in June. It ended up being one of the highlights of our trip! We pulled over and parked (after decsending and finding a great view), No one was up there, it was so quiet and smell of pine was incredible. We sat and listened to birds chirping and nothing else, it was heaven and the view was amazing."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2020,3,"If you're going to compare this to other Rocky Mt resorts you will be very disappointed. If you compare this to mid-west hills you will be pretty happy. If you compare this to east coast hills you will be ""meh, not what I expected the rockies to offer"". So with that said and your expectations adjusted lets talk about the mountain itself. Several nice long on-piste groomers, some nice hidden tree runs that get run out fairly quickly and a couple runs for your newbies and kids but not much to offer for the true beginner. That said the mountain and terrain gets a passing grade of a C. Now for the amenities and lodge/ food etc.. I was almost shocked at the lack of a comfortable place to take a break. The lodge is tiny and dated with one dirty bathroom for the entire resort! The food is a typical cafeteria style with limited options and poor quality. There was a mexican option in a yurt that was even a worse option than the typical hot water burgers and fries drenched in canned cheese. The trip up to the hill is long and windy, the parking is below grade, the rental shop had 5 to 6 yr old skies but were fairly efficient given the amount of people. The people however were great and friendly. The town and stay and eat options are limited and most fall below standard other than a few select places. Do yourself a favor and review everything or ask someone whom has been before you blindly chose your destination for a room or food. In closing; I will return in summer but I will question driving 500 miles again to visit the ski resort unless some major improvements are announced. Oh I forgot lift! They still get you up the hill in 50 yr old double chairs and the main chair is a triple that you sit on for 15 minutes! Wow.."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2019,4,"Skiing during holidays at bargain prices! Beautiful weather, no-wait lift lines, incredible scenery with challenging runs"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2020,3,"Very friendly people. Perfect morning of skiing. A little breezy but not cold. Easy parking. Love this place. Skied right on the lift every time. No lines!!! And, get this.... Sun 🌞"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2020,1,"The mountain seems nice but unfortunately one staff member ruined our experience. My girlfriend and I have tried to snowboard a couple of times in the past but neither of us had even taken a lesson. It had also been a few years before our last attempt. We were in Red Lodge visiting friends for the weekend and we all thought it would be fun to take advantage of the snow by going up to snowboard. Since my girlfriend and I hadn't been in a few years and had never taken a lesson we decided to take advantage of the lesson and rental package the mountain offers. Our instructor, Mitch, was nice enough. During our lesson we had told him we had tried to snowboard a couple of times in the past but had never taken a lesson. After he gave us some basics he took us over to the lift. Once we were there we were berated by another staff member. I believe his name was Craig. He yelled at us because we had tried snowboarding in the past (we assume Mitch informed him when we arrived to the lift) and said we should not have purchased the package. He told us twice that we needed to quit purchasing that deal as if we had done so in the past. He said it was for first timers only and that they have more intermediate lessons for a higher price that we should have paid. It was a little embarrassing and made us feel we did something wrong. Mitch did apologize for his co-worker after we got off the lift but we were still a bit frustrated. After leaving and re-visiting the website we believe we purchased the correct package. I have copied and pasted directly from their website:\n\n""Beginner lessons are perfect for first-time skiers and snowboarders of all ages, and for those who need a little extra work on the basics (turning or stopping). Our learning area and easy-to-ride Magic Carpet provide a safe and fun place to get started.\n\nAll beginner lesson packages include:\n\n1 Miami Beach Lift ticket\n90 minutes of group instruction\nEquipment rentals""\n\nWe definitely needed help with stopping and turning and struggle with falling. Craig needs to review their own policies and not berate paying patrons. His attitude and actions soured our visit. I don't foresee returning here and spending our money when there are much friendlier options. Our friends also mentioned that the season passes have almost doubled in the last few years. Seems like other places are also cheaper. Save your money and visit and more cost effective mountain with friendlier staff."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2020,3,Love coming here to ski. My husband and I are what they call “Super Seniors” (over 70) we’ve been skiing for over 50 years and since moving West from the east coast have been coming here to ski every winter. It’s great for all ages and skills. Our granddaughter and here husband come to ski with us and they love it too. The area has good restaurants and other things to do.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2019,4,The snow was great and the environment excellent for skiing. We were there on a busy day and still never waited in line for more than 5 minutes. Usually it was down and up. The terrain was also varied and in great condition.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2019,4,"This truly is a perfect ski resort for families learning to ski or families with younger kids. We aren't big time skiers but love to ski a few times a year. This resort is clean, the staff are always friendly, and reasonably priced. The one thing I like is that it offers slopes for all abilities and when your kids get old enough to venture on their own or with friends, there is basically 1 main area they have to end up at when coming down from the top/middle. We can always keep an eye on them or so it seems."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2019,3,"Great day, sun, laughs and skiing tops!\n\nChange up patio radio music more please?\nBar tending crew always has hard rock or Pink Floyd playing."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2019,3,"First time to Red Lodge &amp; had super week. 7 in our group &amp; we've been to many different western ski resorts. Kids said Dad, why haven 't you brought us here before? Got 3 of 4 day passes ahead of time for cheap &amp; paid at the window to ski a 4th day. BONUS: After skiing at 28 western ski resorts, I'm now disabled with MS. My cousin &amp; my sons got the ski patrol to give me a snowmobile ride to the top &amp; a ride back down to the bottom in a rescue toboggan for my ""last run"". Nuf to make a grown man cry. My group liked the terrain &amp; the runs &amp; we had a super week &amp; at lunch, my boys said Dad, we got all these beers for only twenty bucks. Gotta luv it."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2019,3,It was a beautiful mountain with friendly people and a beautiful view. The trails are amazing for all levels and not packed at all. There is no traffic or lines. Please come I really recommend the mountain!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2019,4,"This mountain was perfect for our family of four: three snowboarders and one skier. They have a great variety of runs and there were no lines at the chairlifts. The scenery is beautiful and one can easily see why Montana is big sky country. We enjoyed three days on the mountain, two of which were nice and warm, one was a bit windy and chilly. The mountain has a great vibe, fun runs and good value and very family friendly."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2019,5,"We've been to Colorado and other ""high end"" ski locations in the past. This place is the Best! The staff is super friendly and has something to offer for beginners to expert skiers. Super family friendly. The food is a bit pricey but you can pack lunches if you want."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2019,4,Lodges and slopes for all ages and skill ranges. Snacks and food available. Free parking. We all enjoyed the day there.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2019,3,"I had a business trip to billings, and added a day to run down to ski Red Lodge. i'm so glad that i did! It was kid of spur of the moment, and also very inexpensive. $101 for a day lift ticket and full rental of equipment. Free parking as well!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2019,4,"I have skied at Red Lodge Mountain for years. I ski many other areas throughout the country as well. Red Lodge is still our favorite! For a small mountain there are quite a variety of runs and lifts. They welcome families by keeping the ticket price low and inviting picnic lunches to save money on food. The lift operators could not be any friendlier! From purchasing your ticket to grabbing a cup of hot cocoa, Red Lodge Mountain really is a welcoming, friendly example of Montana hospitality!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2019,3,"What a blast! We didn't have the best of snow conditions but sometimes that's just the way it goes. We spent two days on the slopes and loved the unique mounting. Warming huts are tucked away on countless runs and the Mid-Mountain Hut was beautiful!\n\nPalisades offered incredible views and easier skiing for beginners and the Grizzly Chair was great for intermediate or advanced skiers. Only complaint was the road up to the resort, it's a little worn and the parking fills quickly. Besides that the lift lines were short, terrain was great, and staff was incredible! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a big-mountain weekend trip! Enjoy!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2019,3,this is a fun and beautiful place to chill in the beer stoup or ski on the mountain and great food!!nice people too
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2019,4,"I have been sking here since 1985. Been to several states and several ski resorts. For the skiing, cost, and ski town experience this is has to be top 3 in the country. This place is also an easy drive from MN. The last 3 years we have had our best sking in Red Lodge. No lines, amazing amounts of snow we have always had tons of powder, $45 lift tickets, rustic lodge that lets you bring I food, some of the best “locals” you will find anywhere, one of the top small towns in the country. If you really want a true experience try a local motel, the service is outstanding try the Red Lodge Inn. \nThe lift from the lodge is old and tired but it adds to the charm. If you want glitz and glamor and to pay a lot maybe Red Lodge isn’t your first choice. This trip was with 3 college seniors, a junior hockey player, a 10th grader and they all loved it. Everyone said they want to do it again."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr 2018,4,So beautiful &amp; great skiing conditions we had a blast skiing here yesterday very beautiful &amp; lots of runs from beginners to expects.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul 2012,3,Another great site to view in the Red Lodge area...............................................................................................................................................
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,May 2012,3,Drive from Billings to Red Lodge is scenic in the spring as everything is green.\nTown is a pleasure to walk through and stop at shops and dining options are quite good. Eat at Bogarts and the mexican entrees were surprising good.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2011,4,"I love Red Lodge! It might not be super ritzy, but that's fine by me. The lines are short, there's a decent number of runs, and lift tickets aren't too insanely priced. My only complaint is that there are years it doesn't get much snow. The combo of man-made snow and freezing cold MT winters = icy, hard snow. The quality powder is hit-or-miss."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2012,4,"WOW!!! Red Lodge Mountain is great for first time skiers to very advance ones. Every year my family purchases a season ticket for every member and it is well worth the cost. There are three places to eat on the mountain. First is the Main Lodge where they cook Hamburgers, Hot Dogs, Soup, Nachos, Cheese Fries and a ton more things which are very good but it does get very expensive because a Cheese Burger costs $6.50. The second place to eat is the Bierstube which has a huge bar and is a more adult friendly environment. Lastly is the Midway Lodge which is right off of the Midway Ski Lift. If you are looking to have a good time in Red Lodge I would highly recommend that you at least visit the mountain once."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr 2012,4,"We had a great time skiing over the Easter weekend! It snowed while we were there, so the conditions were great for their last weekend. They also had a variety of runs for all the ability levels in our group. It was not very busy the first day--no lines, plenty of room. Saturday &amp; Sunday were considerably busier, but still manageable. We will return next year!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2012,4,"This year has been very exceptional for snow at Red Lodge, but I have always enjoyed the mountain. Had not gone skiing in 17 years, and my 2 teenage sons had never been, so it was time to go again. All of us had a great time, instructors for kid's and wife's lessons were great, lots of people learning that day, so they quickly brought in more instructors.\nThe mountain is really nice, has a mid mountain lodge that serves food also, so a trip to the bottom for lunch or a snack is not necessary. The biggest problem is no lift from bottom of mountain to top of mountain, have to ride 2 chairlifts, and takes some time. But, if you want to stay on the top half of the mountain, always short lift lines at upper chair lift. \n \nNew terrain has opened in the past few years, and really has expanded the mountain. Reasonable lift tickets at $49.00, and lessons, rentals, and lift tickets (beginner lift only) also for $49.00 each. Town is only 10-15 minutes away."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2012,4,What a great place to ski! Terrain for all abilities and fun for the whole family! We'll definitely be back next year!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,,4,A great value - beautiful scenery and a nice mix of runs.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2012,3,Awesome lift operators and brilliant lift mechanics!!!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2012,3,We went to Red Lodge Mountain and enjoyed 2 great days of skiing.The staff at the ski area were so upbeat and helpful. The burgers were awesome
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2021,2,"We skied her because we have the Indy Pass. The ski area was much bigger than expected. The snow was very good. The slopes are not crowded. It was a great experience having good, big skiing and not having to sit in a lift line."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2021,3,"My daughter and I are advanced skiers. The rest of the family is more intermediate but they stayed behind.\n\nLifts\nMain lifts are slow and older. You have to take to chair lifts to summit. They have nicer lifts in the back but they run them slow.\n\nFacilities\nAgain, older. This is a small resort. Do not expect shopping, lots of food and drink. The parking lots are gravel and rough. You need to take steps from the lower lot. These are not necessarily bad things but you need to expect that this more of a local hill.\n\nScenery \nBeautiful views and terrain. Some really pretty rock formations and forests on the backside.\n\nSkiing\nThe stuff that matters. I have to state the snow conditions were end of year. The week after we left they had multiple powder days. While we were there the snow was getting thin and half the trails were very icy. Some of the most icy I have skied. I live and ski regularly in the midwest and we know icy. \nI would not take my intermediate family members to this hill. The groomed runs are short. There is only one good intermediate run from. The summit...Lazy M. The remainder are black and double black, mostly ungroomed. Lots of bumps. My daughter and I worked on our bump skiing all week. The runs are on the thinner side. \n\nSummary\nThis is a skiers mountain. Beautiful scenery, advanced skiing, slow and older facilities...NO CROWDS! Town is great with good food. I wish the snow conditions would have been better...but that is spring!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2021,1,"We travelled from Minnesota to meet family and ski at Red Lodge Mountain. The first day the lift to get up to the top half of the mountain was broken so we could only ski on the bottom half - so we kind of only got half our money's worth (and the prices are getting steep).\n\nThe second morning, my cousin's wife ran afowl of the covid rules by going inside the lodge with her toddler to get out of the snow and warm up (you are supposed to wait in your car all day down in the parking lot) and they were kind of harsh with her about it. So at lunch when my cousin came in and heard about it, he went and told the guy ""don't treat my wife that way"" and a few heated words were exchanged and they could have just left it at that - but they didn't. Soon after, as they were eating, another guy came up and told my cousin and his family and his brother, who wasn't even involved but happened to be sitting with them, to get out - they couldn't ski anymore. They couldn't even finish their overpriced food. It all felt very vindictive.\n\nTo be fair, most of the employees were nice enough and the skiing was pretty good. But it just rubbed me the wrong way that they would pick a fight with a young mother trying to keep her toddler warm and then kick their family out along with a brother that wasn't even involved. Their zeal for covid seems to be overriding any kind of reason or compassion."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2021,1,"After purchasing a two day pass, and then realizing after only 10 mins that my group only did day passes I tried to get a refund on just 1 and it was turned down. Can’t go again as I’m out of state."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2021,3,"My teenage son and my brother and I did a holiday break ski trip through Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota, mostly hitting the little independent places. We stayed in Jackson but skied Snow King and Grand Targhee instead of Jackson Hole. We skied the Tetons, the Bighorns, the Black Hills and Red Lodge. Of all of that, our two days in Red Lodge was my favorite.\n\nI was concerned that the lack of snow was going to severely limit what was available. Nope. True, two of the lifts were closed, but from what I understand that's not unusual... I've read that some seasons they don't open Palisades at all. But no matter. And I will confess that my skis were badly abused, but the terrain was so fun that I just needed to get into the less well covered portions of it.\n\nMy favorite terrain was accessed from the top of Grizzly lift. There were plenty of black diamond mogul runs from there, a popular cruiser called Lazy M, and a nice blue mogul run (Barriers). A really enjoyable non-stop summit-to-base was to dodge moguls and rocks down Barriers, then duck through the trees in Little Forest.\n\nIf you're looking for glamour, forget it. For me, I think that's what I liked about it."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2021,2,"It's no surprise that Red Lodge Mountain has been rapidly increasing their rates in the last 3+ years, but now they have a new money grab. Until a few weeks ago they had normal group lessons for the 4-6yr olds, but they just recently changed it to ""Learn to ski with your child"". This is the only way for your 4 to 6-year-old to receive a lesson. Regardless of whether you are a seasoned skier yourself, you now have to pay $59/$65 extra to accompany your child. Their website states ""This lesson program pairs you and your child with an instructor who will teach you how to safely and effectively ski with your little one, while also providing your child with new skills."" Impossible to teach me how to ""safely and effectively ski with your little one"" when he didn't speak to me or the other dad at all. If the sole reason for having the parent there is for COVID then why is the instructor picking my child up 1/3 of the time. I understand making it mandatory for the parent to be there to assist but to charge the adult $59/$65 just to be there and to not receive any instruction on how to ""safely and effectively ski with your little one"" is completely ridiculous. The whole lesson was ridiculous. It was the instructor and just two children. The instructor didn't seem to want to be there. He barely spoke to the kids and gave them very little instruction. I don't think he even asked them their names or called them by name not even once. This is our 3rd time using the RLM ski school and our older child received excellent instruction on her previous classes in that same age range group lesson in previous years. It's a shame our 5-year-old had such a bad intro to skiing with this instructor. Hoping for a better experience next time."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2020,3,Thank you Red Lodge Mountain! I feel so lucky that I am able to stay safe while skiing. Very appreciative of everyone at RLM who has worked so hard to keep everyone safe this winter and be able to open. I feel safe skiing here knowing that the mountain is following all COVID-19 protocols. Would recommend this place to anyone.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2020,4,"Very family friendly. Relaxing, great runs, The lazy M is a great run for everyone and fits everyone's ability."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2020,1,Unsafe ski resort - stay away. I watched an entire chair fall of the lift today as two people were boarding. Luckily no one was hurt. The lift should have been closed for a safety inspection (duh!) after something like this happened. They re-attached the chair and started running it again right away. What would have happened if it came off when the people were 30 feet up in the air? It was really creepy to watch.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Sep 2020,3,"We loved exploring the lovely, charming and friendly town of Red Lodge. As a bonus we learned that the Highway had reopened after an early season snow storm, so we drove it to the scenic Vista. Spectacular views from every switch back, view point and turn in the rid. Beautiful mountain, and pretty streams in the meadow, too."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,3,"We skied at Red Lodge last week. Even though the warmer temps made for less than ideal skiing conditions, we have a good time. Everyone from the lift operators to restaurant workers to the ticket sellers were great. We will definitely be back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,3,We really enjoyed the ease and convenience of our trip. Ski rental and purchase of lift tickets was fast and easy. No long waits at the lifts. Will definitely be visiting again. Only downside was number of runs open due to lack of natural snow as well as use of runs for competitive events that made them off limits to us and no fun to ski the day after. Very economical.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,4,Had a great father/daughter trip...variety of runs....both of us had a great time..enjoyed no crowds!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,4,"I love Red Lodge Mountain, and I get out there a few times each year. Great people, great town, fun mountain, and way cheaper than most other ski areas in the west. Snow has been a little scarce this season, but they've been doing a great job with what they have."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,5,Never met a more helpful and friendly group of people anywhere. Snow hasn't been great this season but all the staff had a great attitude. Beirstube is great for lunch or after the lifts close for a little unwinding after a day of snowboarding.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,3,"The staff at red logde are absolutely wonderful.They are friendly and helpful. It has a small town feel. Snow could have been better, but can't control mother nature."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,1,"The resort did not have much snow this year, but we were lucky enough to get one to 2 inches while there. Instead of letting everyone ski on it , however, they let it be groomed into a giant ice block. This reflects some very poor management I feel on the mountain, where skiing is not taken very seriously. I will probably only return when there is an abundance of snow."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,3,"Red Lodge is quaint, the people are friendly, and the runs are well worth the drive. We snowboarder on Sunday and Monday and never waited for the lift."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,2,"Staff at Red Lodge Mountain are fantastic, as was the mountain itself. Was frustrating however that although totally understandable for patron safety the lifts were closed due to high winds until noon that once opened a little after 12:00 we still had to pay for the entire day even though we lost more than 3 hours of skiing time."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,4,"Great day on the mountain, fresh snow, great employees. Buy your ticket online for great savings. Easy drive to the mountain, road well maintained."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2016,2,"Joined extended family for a ski/snowboard vacation at Red Lodge and left disappointed in the experience at Red Lodge Mountain. While the town of Red Lodge is very quaint and the people are extraordinarily nice, the mountain and runs are very lacking. First, for beginners like my youngest child, there were no good options. The one run that really caters to beginners (Miami Beach) was hampered by a chairlift that was shut down for a significant portion on two separate days and then was coaxed to work by skipping every other chair for at least three more days. Second, for intermediate skiers there are a few okay runs, but none of them were fantastic and many were very icy and seemed to be over-groomed. And this has been a fairly decent season weather-wise. There are a decent number of expert runs, but none of them were all that long. Again, the weather has been pretty good here this season so far, but there were very few runs that had good powder. They are hopeful to open a few more runs in the upcoming days, but that will do us no good. Our family took a day trip and went to Bridger Bowl just north of Bozeman (a 2-1/2 drive from Red Lodge) and were blown away by how much better that mountain was ... and the cost was the same. If you want to go on a nice ski vacation in Montana, there are many better options than Red Lodge."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2016,4,"Not enough GREEN runs, and the BLUE runs were more difficult that expected. Be sure to ski (or board) ""Lazy-M"" - it became my favorite Lift attendants and staff at the lodge were helpful, freely gave assistance and were friendly!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2016,5,"This is a great mountain to ski on, the staff are always friendly and the runs are fun. I know this is more of a spring skiing place, when the snow hits there isn't a run you don't want to go on"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2016,5,No lift lines. All types of terrain. Incredible views. Reasonable prices. The snow was plentiful and the people are friendly. What more could you want?
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,5,"This may sound bad, but we don't ski here as much as we used to. Typically, we stop now on the way out to Bozeman or Big Sky, or on the way home. There are not a lot of decent hotel choices that accommodate 5, and there are many places we used to stay that I wont go back to anymore. That does have an impact on us skiing here. The mountain itself struggles with snow - I would say only 4 times out of 20+ years have we skied the expansion territory - and it is some fun area to ski. That's not anyone's fault - just the way it is. When they get dumped on, there is nothing like it - it is a blast."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,4,We have skied at Red Lodge twice and had a great experience on both trips. Friendly staff and short lines...great ski resort!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul 2016,5,"After our tremendous ride on the Beartooth Highway, we visited the town of Red Lodge. Many good restaurants, nice town to walk, great family time. Just a fun afternoon with the family."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Nov 2015,3,My husband and I went up to the Lodge to watch the skiers and snow boarders come down the mountain. Had a hot chocolate and just relaxed.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,5,We were here in Jan 2016 and skied 4 days here. Good place with no lines. We enjoyed it and will be back.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2016,3,"Since ND had no snow, we went to Red Lodge. We got our lift tickets in advance &amp; skied a total of 7 the 3 weekends we were out there. The lift attendants were very professional &amp; courteous! Hard to find in this day &amp; age. The staff in the rental shop(skied w/one of them) &amp; the staff at the store were also great!. The ski instructors were always busy. I had thought about doing the learn &amp; earn package, that way they could get off the bunny hill &amp; do some skiing w/another ski instructor. But we didn't have time. The staff at the Midway Chalet were great &amp; the Staff at the Bierstube were always courteous. The ""Stube"" was always packed when we were there, &amp; the staff was always apologizing for our food taking so long. I have been in their shoes &amp; understand. We always thanked them &amp; told them we are ok &amp; not in a hurry. It put a couple of the waitresses at ease! kudos to Madeline for busting her buns the 3 weekends we were there."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2013,4,"My wife and I went back to Red Lodge to ski after over 10 years. We had the best time. Took in part of the Winter Carnival on the mountain, and enjoyed skiing with no lift lines and open runs. Weather was great and the snow good for the most part."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2013,4,"Food was cheap and the lift lines were next to nothing. Good local mountain - get there early so you don't have to walk a mile to the mountain. They offer a shuttle in the morning, but you'll have to walk back to your car in the afternoon - the earlier you get there, the closer you park."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2013,5,"We love skiing Red Lodge Mountain! \n\nThe members of the staff are all very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe lodge atmosphere is relaxed and casual. \n\n RLM is very family-oriented with the magic carpet and Miami Beach lift for beginners. \n\nHowever, there are green, blue, &amp; black diamond trails for all levels of skiers.\n\nThe town of Red Lodge is one of the friendliest anywhere with beautiful, historic district houses &amp; buildings. \n\nA best-kept secret in the Rockies!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2013,4,A nice local ski area without all the resort hype. Outstanding terrain on a powder day. Worth the stop on the way to Big Sky.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,,5,We had family fun day in the snow....the price was great and the staff was wonderful...being out of shape was a issue ...but we still had a blast...we spent 5 hour had lunch and went home for naps....
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Nov 2012,5,sweet place . lots to see and do. great food. also try off road MeetsieTeetsie trail nearby. Ski area is also great\n
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2012,4,"We ski there two or three times a year. Lots of terrain and the lines are very short. The longest I ever wait is maybe two minutes. The double black diamonds are exactly that...don't go there unless you are an EXPERT! Terrain park is really fun. Most scenic section is Palisades chairlift, only open when it is busy on the weekends and there is a lot of snow. The Midway Lodge is half way up the mountain and has good eats for a fair price."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Oct 2012,3,"Grew up on this mountain and love it just because it's the local place to hang out - you're constantly running into people you know. :) When it gets good snow, it's completely epic. Most of the year, it seems you're dodging a few ice patches and/or rocky spots, but that's just the essence of Red Lodge. :) Plus, if you know where to go, you'll get the good white stuff!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2011,5,"excellent rates, helpful staff. We visited over xmas break and it was my daughter's first time skiing. We signed her up for lessons, rented skis and bought lift tickets for the ""easy"" lift only and the cost was only around $100 for the both of us. She spent the morning learning to ski and we had a wonderful afternoon skiing together. Lovely facility and a great price"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul 2012,3,Really cute town with shops and restaurants. Easy to get around in by foot or car. Easy access to the mountains - Yellowstone and skiing.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,3,So much fun when there is not a lot of people. Had zero lines on Christmas Eve it was a lot of fun!!!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,5,The staff is wonderful on the mountain. Not all runs covered in snow due to high winds the days before but the runs that were open were great.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,4,"Ronnie working at the Miami beach lift is amazing with the new kids. So gentle and encouraging. \nThe other gentleman scanning tickets took time to explain to me why my sons board bindings weren't correct, what I needed to buy and how it affected his ankles and ride. Thanks for the exceptional staffing!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,5,Red Lodge is always fun! The instructors and lift operators are always so nice! Love visiting this place!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,4,"The whole crew was excellent from the get go, from picking up our lift tickets purchased online, to the very streamlined equipment rental process and getting on the very first lift all the way to the last ride up and then the rental returns! Every employee we spoke to, or even passed by, was extremely freindly and very helpful. Even during the rush in the morning they did not get flustered or irritated, in fact it was quite the opposite, just took us all in stride and got us out the door! When we returned our gear and my fat belly prevented me from getting my boots off in a proffecient manner, one of the employees came over and gave me a hand with a smile. We were asked so many times ""How is the snow, how are you doing, are you enjoying the day?"" Every time we got on a lift we were told ""have a great run"" or "" enjoy it up there"". I am extremely impressed with the whole operation and highly recommend a day on the mountain at Red Lodge, the people make it great!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,3,Everyone was very helpful and welcoming. Great mountain with staff that was always so nice and caring.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,3,1st time I purchased tickets online////saved 34%/// dropped the boys and their mother off///parked the truck///walked back to ticket office showed the confirmation paper tickets were given to me///boys were on lift within 10 minutes///// very nice service
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,4,Snow was great! Sucks that there was no running water and Indoor bathrooms. We didn't let that put a damper on our day though! Food was awesome too! We had a fantastic day!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,2,"Half or less open ,bare spots ,rocks ,ice, everything (walking wise) seems to be up hill, anything from parking area to lifts. Seems more like an east resort. Maybe wrong time w/low snow."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,5,"we have been skiing there for a long time I try to go about 4 times a year,I plan on retiring there people are so friendly and the senrey is to die for."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2014,4,"I was happy with my first experience of Red Lodge Mountain. Being a powder snob, I have not been to this resort before, as it usually gets less snow cover than other ski areas that I frequent in Montana. However, I was pleased this season with my spring snowboarding day here. Not only was it a blue sky fabulous day (although any day on the mountain is a good day :-P ), but the runs were long and face NE, so the snow stayed good until the bottom bit of the mountain, even though the sun was beating down.\n\nDid I say it had LOOONG runs? And the employees were great and the atmosphere was that of a little local ski area instead of a destination spot like Red Lodge. How cool is that?!!\n\nThanks for the end of my season Red Lodge Mountain. It was a stellar day, and I got to be with my sweetheart on top of it. Best snowboard day EVER! LOL"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2014,5,"The price was very good, the people very helpful and the skiing was perfect. My partner took a lesson, and that didn't work out too well, but figure that is on us, we should have signed up for a higher level. When they say beginner, they mean you have never put skis on before"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2014,4,"The snow was great, there were no crowds (except at the bar at the end of day), abundant varied terrain offered a challenge and the views from the top were spectacular. The only downside was that the base facilities are very crowded."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2014,4,"We liked the terrain, and grooming. Nice lifts. It would be nice to have an inexpensive shuttle from town."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2014,5,"Very family friendly, with a family friendly budget. Wonderful staff, really took time with the kids to refresh their skills and they were able to pick right up where they left off last year!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2014,3,"The line cooks don't understand how to cook more than a single order at a time. Forty minutes after we ordered our waitress assured us it would be ready in 'just a minute'. Ten minutes later, she assured us again. Five minutes later she brought us the hamburger, and then informed us the sausages had just been put on the grill. In total - one hour and five minutes to get a hamburger, two sausages and a cup of soup. Yes, the place was full and a few tables outside were occupied. Everyone seemed to be going through the same hostage scenario. I've worked as a line cook, a waiter, and bartender, so I know the capabilities and expectations of a kitchen, and this kitchen is totally incompetent. At the very, very least they should inform anyone wishing to order food how long they should expect to wait."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2014,4,"Skied there in late January 2014. Snow conditions were great the mountain has a good variety of well groomed cruising runs and many more difficult, powder opportunities, lots of terrain to ski. Lifts on the newer areas of the hill are high speed quads, no lift lines at all while I was there. Hill staff are all very friendly. Nice place to get away from it all and do some relaxing and serious skiing."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2013,4,"This is the ""old"" Colorado. Great slopes, great snow, low prices, not crowded, nice people and NOT over-commercialized! We loved this place!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2013,5,"What an amazing place. The runs are really long. . . and really steep. We are used to skiing in Minnesota and this is a whole new level. It was an amazing experience. The blue hills are the equivalent to the black diamonds in Minnesota, though. The chalet is nice. Parking is great if you arrive when the rental/ticket office opens. Buy advanced tickets online and save a lot of money. If you rent for multiple days, you will need to decide if you want to keep the equipment or leave it overnight in a locker there. Overall, it was an amazing experience."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2013,3,Having enough snow can be an issue at any resort. RLM has more snow making equipment than any resort I've ever seen. The terrain is really varied so there's something for everybody. The prices are very reasonable the drinks are good the food is great and there is a party in town every night.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2015,5,I Loved this little place. it is a very small and cozy. Everyone is super nice. something for everyone.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,,3,Fair prices along with a good time if theres snow. I've been a few times and when theres snow this place is a blast! If not it seems the snow they make themselves was super icy and the skiing/boarding was no fun.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2014,3,"While there is a nice beginners area near the base, Red Lodge Mountain has plenty of room for advanced skiers with some potentially deep powder and trees on the advanced Cole Creek side. Lift lines are seldom and the mountain is large enough, it doesn't seem crowded. Even before Cole Creek was open, we could still find glade skiing on the rest of the mountain after a nice Christmas storm."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2014,1,The snow was packed ice and the staff was rude. Even on main runs there were sticks and rocks sticking up everywhere. All in all I was very disappointed with my experience. I won't be back.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,,3,"Red Lodge Mtn is great. Small ski resort w little lift lines, great staff and the food is always great. Try the soups and sandwiches. We will be back."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Nov 2014,2,"We skied Red Lodge Mountain on Thanksgiving weekend. There were hardly any lines but they had issues with lifts on a couple of different occasions. They have one high speed quad which was not open at the time of our visit. Group ski lessons were 1:1 instructor to student but no GPS device to see how much they've skied as they have at Winter Park, Colorado. The powder was deep. We sat on a broken lift for thirteen minutes in seriously cold weather. We were slightly perplexed at the lack of barricade on the dirt road leading to the mountain. There is no base lodge hotel, buildings are dated but there is a mid mountain dining spot and several buildings at the base that house rental shop, retail, and restaurants. At the mid-mountain lodge there was a significant collection of dead moths on the handrails leading to the bathroom however none ended up in our food. A beer here costs $4.75 and that's microbrew draft. Due to the fact that half the mountain was closed lift tickets were selling at the half day rate. Book two days for about $60 advance online and there are also good deals to be had at liftopia. Still, I find myself yearning for my favorite Colorado mountain with serious bumps, high speed lifts, and multiple dining options on the mountain."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr 2014,3,"Second consecutive year of skiing at Red Lodge and the hill continues to deliver. Diverse terrain - including some real steeps and challenging side-country skiing - along with long blues and greens; small numbers; friendly and helpful staff and locals; and real value. \n\nOh, and the snow is just the icing on the cake - simply epic at times. \n\nLiving in Manitoba, we still feel that the skiing at Red Lodge makes the drive down south of the border totally worthwhile. We'll definitely be back!\n\nTip: the lift ticket is already cheap but still look for the deals to be had at Liftopia.com"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul 2014,3,"If you are in the area, don't pass up the drive to Red Lodge via the Beartooth pass. It is incredible and the town of Red Lodge is absolutely charming!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr 2014,4,"I have never in my life have stepped into skis.. My fiance is a hard core skier and his friends (who are also big time skiers) invited us to come for the last weekend of skiing at Red Lodge (We live in South Dakota-although originally from Washington State). They encouraged me to take a ski lesson and I did! I was really nervous at first and was afraid of falling. I had a wonderful instructor named Mary who was very patient and helpful. By the end of the lesson I was doing some turns. Although I just stayed on the magic carpet ( I was way to tired at the end to try Miami Beach) I was very happy with the lesson and my progress. Mary was a WONDERFUL instructor!! Please pass that on! (I'm a teacher so I know what good teaching is like) It was a gorgeous day too so that helped. I tried it again the next day but it was snowy and more icy so I didn't feel as confident. I had a different instructor too. Still, I loved my experience at Red Lodge. My fiance loved it too and said it was some of the best skiing he's done-(especially after it dumped all that snow on Sunday!) We can't wait to come back next year!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2014,4,"We brought a small group from a small school. The mountain and skiing was great, the organization of the trip was a bit more stressful than need be. We tried to get a group rate ahead of time but we're told that they had ""too many"" groups for that two days and so no discounts. It was a bit crazy and $$ but we had a good time!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2015,3,"Groomers and power runs. Very nice lodge close to the summit, but unfortunately only open on weekends. Fortunately, the restrooms ARE open all days."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2015,2,"Skied two days at Bridger Bowl, but knew that Red Lodge had received 17 inches of snow two days before, so decided to go there. Spent most of the time skiing the Palisades area. Great runs and a high speed lift. With the new snow, the rest of the ski area was great. If weather turns warm, they may lose snow fast."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2015,3,"I have never been to Montana and had a few days off work so I decided to take myself snow boarding. I am a skier but want to learn snow boarding. The drive to Red Lodge was exciting; it is such beautiful country. Red Lodge is a quaint little town with many shops and places to eat. The drive up to Red Lodge Mountain from the town is also exciting. I was particularly fastinated by the sign that requires you to have snow chains or a vehicle that can navigate the steep, often snow laden passage. I realized why on my second day to the hill as I had to climb the mountain in very near white out conditions. Which only caused me to be more excited. Once at the lodge the staff were very helpful and attentive in getting my gear, rental, and onto the slopes. I went right to the Magic Carpet (bunny hill) as my lesson did not start for another hour. The Lift Attendant (aka: Liftie), Bob was so helpful in giving me pointers to get me started. Then, my lesson with Brianna was excellent. She helped me to form a good foundation. My second day on the slopes I went up the Miami Beach Lift. It was snowing the second day so that meant very different skiing conditions. But, the tools that Brianna gave me equipped me for all conditions. I look forward to continuing to snow board and hopefully soon be able to carve like Brianna. Thank you Red Lodge. You have great employees and you gave me a superb snow boarding experience. I look forward to coming back."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2015,5,"We make it to Red Lodge every year! By far one of if not our favorite place to ski that we have visited. We skiied it twice this year and loved it again...the 2+ feet of fresh powder was amazing of coarse!! Great overall mountain with a little bit of everything, no matter what type of skier you are you shouldn't be disappointed! No lift lines and an excellent staff from ski patrol, resturant, and the gift shop employees make this a place I look forward to visiting year after year!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2015,5,"On February 17 a group of 44 middle school students from Frank Brattin Middle School in Colstrip made a ski trip to Red Lodge Mountain. Annalee was instrumental in organizing this trip, the guys in the rental shop were great and got the kids checked in and out the door in record time. We had many first time skiers and snowboarders. After their lesson they were set loose to ski and snowboard and had a really good day. Our more experienced skiers and snowboarders took advantage of the nice day and spent the entire time on the mountain. A great day was had by all."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2015,5,Have been there twice this Winter and it has been wonderful both times. It is a Huge Mountain with a small lodge feel. We have been both times on a Friday/Saturday Trip and it is definetly a busy place on a Saturday. If you are a first timer to a bigger Mountain and need some space i would suggest going during the week. Also if you are on a Budget be sure to purchase your 'Super savers' Lift tickets ahead of time. The earlier you buy the more you save. Definetly eat at the Midway Chalet or the Beirstube. Skip the Cafeteria.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2015,5,Katie is an amazing employee! She helped make my visit to red lodge better than expected! Nature isn't always far for red lodge but employees like Katie make the trip worth it!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2015,4,"We really, really loved skiing at Red Lodge! The days we were there, it hadn't snowed in forever and it was really warm. Two of the chairlifts and many of the ski runs were closed. But. BUT! The snow had really held up better than I had anticipated and we enjoyed some really great skiing on a wide variety of terrain in spring-like conditions. The snow was soft and fun. We spent a lot of time at the mid-mountain Chalet, too, where the food was better than most ski resorts I've been to! We had a blast on this mountain, and especially for the relatively low price of lift tickets, we left very happy and satisfied. This resort feels like a locals ski playground. I hope they never loose their small-town charm!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2015,4,Small Town Ski atmosphere. Great Skiing! Virtually no lift lines. Lower and mid-mountain chalets. Well groomed runs.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2015,3,"My buddy and I decided that we werent going to hit the slopes the first day. My wife and her friend stll wanted to so we decided to go hit up the bar there. That place is FUN. The food was good but the beers and the environment were awesome. They even had the Packer/Seahawk game on. Next time we are in Red Lodge I am going to hit the slopes, which my wife told me was great. No chair lift wait times really. Only problem is that the power went out and the lifts stopped working for about a half hour or so. I would recommend checking this place out whether your skiing or not!! You will have fun either way."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,3,"Our 5 year old daughter got a great lesson from Ronald. We had a good time, even though the snow was pretty thin. We will be back when there is more snow. Pack a lunch, the food is expensive for what you get."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,4,"Great people, great slopes and cold beer. Can't go wrong. A definite must when visiting Montana!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,3,"We made a ""last minute"" decision to enjoy Red Lodge Mountain while my daughter was home on Holiday break from College-While the snow wasn't great the combined low price of lift tickets on line and low gas prices made it a great day! No lines at the lifts, food, rentals,etc-great parking and the staff was professional and courteous-It's a shame more people don't take advantage of the combined value and fun-We had a really nice Father-Daughter day that was low key, low stress,affordable, and enjoyable-I would-(and probably will) do a mid week visit to my favorite ski area again-Montana Values from a great Montana Ski destination-Thanks for the great day!-"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,5,"We had a great time. It is so local and personalized. The staff were all sweet, friendly and helpful. Low prices and polite low-key skiiers. Hate to give glowing reviews because it might draw in the wrong element, but it is true! Loved it!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,4,"This will be our new favorite ski mountain. $38 on-line lift tickets, incredible terrain. They just need more snow as half the runs were closed. However, grooming is top notch and the place is almost deserted. Staff is the friendliest we've ever met."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,3,"The skiing and scenery were sublime, to top it off the locals and staff were very welcoming and friendly, the hospitality here is second to none."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,2,Extremely Friendly staff. The backside of the mountain was closed. Single digit temperatures outside.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,2,"Overall, this trip went well... except EVERY TIME we come we have trouble with the lockers! Took $3 from us, so we ended up just throwing our bag on top of locker &amp; hope it didn't get stolen! Grrr! Lock stuff in car!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,3,"I'm a terrible skier, so take my review for what it's worth. I had great fun learning, the staff was courteous and nice, the slopes were great."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,4,Had a great time at Red Lodge Mountain! The best parts about the trip were the good skiing conditions and the lessons that my 5 year old son and 7 year old niece took. By the end of the first day my 5 year old son was off the beginner hill and successfully went down a green run riding a lift to the top! He was elated and so was the whole family! The staff at Red Lodge are top notch and care about your visit to their mountain.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,5,Awesome time best instructor for getting me started. On the snowboard . I have been a skier since I was 3 and have finally decided to learn he snowboarding . I have skied only in Australia perisher / smiggins blue cow have a lodge in smiggins . Totally loved the friendly atmosphere and personalized experience with the instructors and staff .

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,4,"We went to Red Lodge Mountain for a skiing vacation during last Christmas week. It is a nice place, quiet and neat. The mountain is not very crowed. Only half is open but the tickets were still in full price. Services are excellent, people are friendly and helpful."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,4,not bad at all but yeah this mountian was pretty good for not having all the snow that they normally have
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,3,Had a great time on the mountain with family. My kids are beginner snowboarders and this is a great place for them to learn and master their skills.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,5,"I learned how to ski years ago by taking a lesson at Red Lodge Mountain. My boys both learned how to snowboard by taking lessons there as well. The group lessons are wonderful. It has always been a treat to go skiing there. We try to make the trip for a couple weekends a year, and have been doing so for almost 20 years. The staff are very friendly and helpful! It's so worth the 7 hour trip to ski this mountain!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,4,The ski instructors are very nice and professional. My family had a great time! We went on a Saturday and didn't ever have to stand in lines longer than 5 people ahead of us. They happily slowed the chair lifts for my youngest inexperienced daughter to get on without difficulty. Everyone was very friendly. The snow was good. A few slopes were closed for not enough snow. But the majority were open. It was a great day!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,3,"My first visit to Red Lodge Mountain was on a Saturday, so it was crowded with families but since there is enough room to spread out, this didn't present a problem. There were no long lines for lifts. There were lots of people in the lodge, but enough room to accommodate them comfortably. There were lots of options on the trails for skiers of all levels. The only drawback was the snow quality was not great. On the website, the base depth was listed as 18"" to 20"". I don't think I came across an area that had more than 10"" and there were large patches of dirt exposed in some of the busier areas. With a deeper base and some powder, this would be a great place to ski!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,4,"Wonderful experience!! Everyone was accommodating. There was never long lines, it is obvious that this business knows how to provide great customer service and experience!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,4,Had a great time skiing with my daughters. Friendly staff are always willing to help. The Beirsteub is good for relaxing with a beer and some great food.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2016,2,"No snow, which was not fault of resort, but was treated terribly. MOST important, the only two decent runs were horrid by ski racing, one both days, one run wasn't properly signed and led us (with two 3 year olds) to black diamond runs - with NO WARNING; on the second day, we 'broke; the tape on the practice run to get our young ones down safely and were stopped and berated by the ""practice"" team. I am a former professional snowboarder, and it has been a long time since I have been so disappointed in a resort."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,3,"My most recent visit to Red Lodge, I was welcomed by 16"" of new powder! Needless to say, my day on the mountain was great. I grew up skiing Red Lodge and always love going there, even if the snow isn't good, it's a good excuse to sit in the Bierstube!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,2,"Came here with family to snowboard. Before we got on first lift, lift attendent walked passed us and said ""ugh, snowboarders"". We had a good half day, then at two pm the lift attendents started checking for leashes so wouldn't let us up the lifts unless we went to shops to buy a leash. Evidently this is a state law, but we live in Montana and have never ever had this happen and we are frequent snowboarders all over the state. The new snowboards do not need this device because we strap or foot in when we go on the lift. So no other mountain enforces this outdated law because of this reason. Would not recommend this resort if you are a snowboarder. Unless you want to spend $7 at the store for a leash (and put a ring on your boot too because they don't even make a place to put a leash on new boots)"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2015,4,We are teaching my 3-year-old to ski and Red Lodge Mountain is a perfect resort for kids. Family friendly base lodge with helpful staff and just enough terrain for everyone to have a good time.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul 2015,3,It is a great end to driving the Bear Tooth Highway. Perfect way to close out the scenic drive and get a few more fantastic views.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2014,3,"Small town ski area feel. Good runs, nice variety of terrain. Mostly an intermediate's mountain but there is some expert terrain if you seek it out. Lift system seems a bit disjointed but functional. Red Lodge town is fun at night for plenty of apris ski activities."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul 2015,3,We loved the mountain and all of the scenery after taking the Beartooth Highway(route 212) from tower junction in Yellowstone to Red Lodge. Take your time and enjoy the sites around this beautiful mountain. Great views from every angle!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jun 2015,4,"From the drive to the mtns to how serene the campsites are...it's an impeccable place to visit! Even if you're not fond of heights, go on the switchbacks to the top...you won't be disappointed."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2015,3,Great ski classes the instructors are super nice a good variety of slopes a great little place for beginners I'll come back every year :)
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul 2014,3,it's really awesome small town in the valley of mountains. best to visit in summer and ski seasons. It is in the way to Yellowstone national park. It is place to take holiday from concrete jungle cities and nurture nature.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2015,4,Most of the lifts are old school and the road up the mountain is dirt - but this mountain is a blast to ski with lots of varied terrain and the snow was great even though it had been very warm for the two weeks prior to our visit.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,3,Best spring skiing in years! Friendly staff with lots of cold beers on tap! Not crowded at all! Excellent snow!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,"Great mountain for every level of skier. Personable staff that are willing to help everyone. Short lift lines, quick lift rides and amazing scenery."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,We were on a ski trip to Montana this past March. Red Lodge Mountain was the first ski area we visited. The staff at the ticket window were helpful. And our skiing experience was very nice.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,3,"If you are looking for a TRUE Montana ski experience try Red Lodge Mountain. Over the past several years I have seen skiers wearing cowboy hats and jeans, a moose crossing the road heading up the mountain and deer running across a ski run. Many days you feel like you have the place to you and 10 friends. Even when there's lots of people the lift lines move along quickly. This is a great place to have a family Montana ski vacation that gives you a ski town feel without needing to take out a loan to pay for it. If pretentious skiers is what you're looking for this is NOT your place. But if you seek a great family friendly mountain with fun runs and amazing views and is often referred to be considered a hidden gem, you found your place. A lift ride conversation here, may very well end in a long-lasting friendship!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,We heard from word of mouth about Red Lodge Mountain. It was all the website promised. Pure and simple. We will return.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,"I've been snowboarding for 5 years and this is the best place I've ever been. Excellent trails for boarding and best of all, NO LINES. The longest you will wait in a lift line is 25 seconds TOPS. And this was when they were busy in mid March."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,"Good variety of slopes and value for a day of skiing. Very friendly staff! Not crowded at all! Rental shop was good, too!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,3,"Despite a cloudy day, we had a blast skiing here. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful as we were not familiar with the slopes. The slopes were in good condition and runs were great. The only hinderance, very little visibility because of snow and a cloud was out of their control. I hope I can come back and ski there again."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,5,Red Lodge is a great ski lodge for the entire family! The staff are exceptionally friendly even at the end of their season! The chalet is nice with amazing chocolate chip cookies and the bar is a great place to rest at the end of the day to wait for the kids to come off of the mountain! The absolute best was that we had an opportunity to ski above the clouds...amazing!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,3,We had a great 3 days of skiing. The weather was nice and warm. Roughly 50 each day. The first day was a little icy but after that it was great. We were able to ski the entire mountain. Many of the chutes on cold creek even opened up.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,4,"We loved it! Very family friendly. Lost and found was even good to us😏\nWe found reasonable room rates (on short notice) at the Yodeler ( which I will also review) discounted lift tickets on line, and convenient ski rentals in town (no lines!)\nWe will be back!\n\n"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,5,"We have taken our family to Red Lodge skiing on several occasions. We are from out of state, and it is a long drive, but always worth it. The prices are fair, the service is great, and there lift lines are short or non-existent. It is our 'home' mountain and we are proud to make the trek there as often as we can!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,4,"Well-groomed. Wished more runs were open, but that really had to do with lack of snow. Friendly staff!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,2,"Hard ice which made it difficult to ski, maybe a refund should have been offered or not sold ski lift tickets."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,4,Had a great time skiing. Very friendly and helpful personnel at the lifts. Food in the lodge was quick and good.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,5,"Best Staff Ever!!\nI was here from Bozeman and a ring of mine was lost somewhere between the car to the deck. I was frantic and upset because this ring meant a lot to me as my Nana gave it to me almost 10 years ago on her death bed.\nThe staff at Red Lodge went above and beyond to help me find it! They went as far as to grab an electric screwdriver and began taking apart the deck In hopes to find it!! Although we did not find i that day, I will never forget the trouble they went through to help me find it!\n3 days later, I just received a call saying it was found!! I am so thankful for all they have done for me.\nThank you Red Lodge!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,5,"every time we have been there the staff at the ski area have been great. love it when the lefties always say ""Have a great run!"" sometimes you surprise them by answering with something off the wall!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,5,"5 Stars for Red Lodge Ski Patrol! We went skiing on President's Day. The conditions were icy. My husband had only been skiing at a ""Hill"" in ND. We should've gotten him some lessons, but we didn't and he super-manned it down the mountain quite a few times on his belly. The ski-patrol was there to help, some of whom weren't even on duty that day! We tapped-out at noon, covered in snow-rash. We will be back for lessons and powder! Thank you Red Lodge ski-patrol!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,4,"There was a lot of ice areas. But, I am sure it was due to all the warm weather that had occurred the week before and then it froze. We had a lot of fun and would like to come back during better weather and ski again. The bar was fun and the food/drinks were great! The employees' were very friendly."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,3,"My 11 year old went up with some friends for a long weekend. When I asked him how it was, he said ""I'm sore"". To me that's a huge 2 Thumbs up! He also went up the triple chair and said he went off a couple boxes. He wants to go back every weekend!! Thanks Red Lodge for helping my boy make memories!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,4,I would love it if Red Lodge had a childcare system for the kids that can't ski. I end up sitting in the lodge the whole day with the baby and toddler while the two older kids and husband get to ski.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,3,"We visited Red Lodge over the New Year holiday and had an amazing time! All the staff employed at Red Lodge Mountain were wonderful, from the parking attendants, gift shop, snack bar, to the lift attendants. You can tell that they all love their jobs, they were always smiling and greeting us, asking how the runs are and suggesting where to go next. Thanks for a great ski vacation, can't wait to go back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,3,"The terrain and skiing are good. The bathrooms in the base lodge are gross -- on par with a seedy truck stop. The base lodge is rather small and is crowded on busy days. Lifts are slow and on the latest trip one lift was running at half speed due to a mechanical issue that purportedly won't be fixed until next year. Food and beverage prices are very high, quality is average at best. The town of Red Lodge is very nice."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2016,3,We had a great time at Red Lodge skiing. It was windy one day but was awesome the others. My kids are new to skiing and they loved the good options for green runs.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,4,"I thought it was a pretty awesome place. Decent snow. Very cold. Only downfall is the triple lift was a little slow. Terrain park was fun, back country was decent. Overall enjoyable"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,5,"We went skiing and had a blast, the people were friendly, The food was great, The Yodeler motel was very clean and reasonable priced, The Red lodge brewing co was very good and the skiing was awesome."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,4,"It was a great trip overall. Awesome groomers, awesome ski lift operators, great lodging. Wouldn't mind more park tho. Love box rails and mini kickers. Need more of them."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,5,My boys first time and they loved it so of course dad love it! The staff was great and helpful! The mountain was great skiing! My boys still talk about the instructor and the lift guys! Thank you for taking care of my family for a great day!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2016,4,"Lift help was friendly, lines were short. Kids took lessons in the morning and the instructor was very friendly as well. Not a lot of snow yet but was well manicured."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2016,3,"We were at Red Lodge the week between Christmas and New Years. Lift lines were short and the staff was great. Very fun, relaxed ski area."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2019,2,Mountain wasn’t groomed. Like at all. Gift shop only had huge sizes in both men’s and women’s clothes. The Stube (restaurant/bar) needs to be bigger it was soooo crowded you couldn’t walk. Draft beers were good but the famous beer cheese dip was nothing special.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2018,3,Great skiing in a true Western town. Great prices for amazing skiing. Easy drive from Red Lodge up the mountain. No shuttle though
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2018,3,This is a cute mountain. Am I supposed to say cute? Haha First time I have been there. Certainly different than the big resorts in Wyoming and Utah but I liked the atmosphere. Seemed very family friendly. \nThe conditions were way different than I expected but again early season and not really knowing the mountain well we were in some runs that weren’t my cup of tea. Overall it was a good experience and if we go back it will be later in the season. \nThe magic carpet and beginning area was great!! My husband took our 3 year old down on her snowboard and the price is perfect~ free!!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2018,4,"I’ve grown up in the Red Lodge area and have been skiing RLM since I was 3 years old. I don’t have enough good things to say, it’s a small community oriented mountain with big terrain. \nThere are rarely any lift lines and plenty of hidden terrain. Red Lodge has a easygoing, resort town vibe and lots of restaurants for after the mountain closes. Beginners have easy access to easy terrain and good instructors at their disposal. Intermediate will be delighted at the signature “Lazy M.” Advanced skiers will find excellent tree skiing and steeps off of Cole Creek."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr 2018,4,I would highly recommend taking a lesson prior to skiing if you have never skied. Our instructors were patient and kind. I would also suggest buying a ski helmet. Our family rented skis etc and thought we could purchase helmets at the store if needed. Helmets were scarce so we went without - would not recommend. As a family we flew into Billings so we didn’t want to pack too much. Beautiful mountain and helpful staff.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr 2018,4,We are a family of snowboarders. We love this mountain. It has such great variety for all of us. We’ll be back again. The only ding is the parking lot is nasty to drive or walk through.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr 2018,4,So beautiful &amp; great skiing conditions we had a blast skiing here yesterday very beautiful &amp; lots of runs from beginners to expects.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2018,2,"We visited during March of 2018 for my son to compete in a free-ride competition and unfortunately the snow conditions were poor. There was plenty of snow but we hit it after a week of warm weather and then cold temps the days were we there left the snow rock hard to icy. The lower mountain groomers were ok in the afternoon after the sun had softened them a bit. The chairs that service the area from the bottom near the lodge are S-L-O-W. Right at the base there is a triple chair, a carpet tow for the beginner area, a double that accesses easy terrain, and another double that starts a little higher up but accesses the same terrain as the triple. But once you get back in the Cole Creek and Palisades areas, those have high speed quads to move you along. The terrain would be fabulous with some fresh snow. The view from the top of the Grizzly chair is amazing, and skiing down in the Palisades area is very picturesque. So it's got a lot going for it and would be a great area with better snow. There's also a midway chalet on the upper part of the mountain that offers a nice bar and grill."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2018,3,Great little spring break trip! Would recommend to anyone who is learning or already a master! The lift operators are very nice and helpful if you need directions! The lodge is a very welcoming area with a cozy wood fireplace smell!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2018,3,"Altitude without the attitude! This is a great, no frills, skiing mountain; no lines, no crowds on the hill, VERY picturesque and inexpensive tickets! Limited options for group lessons in comparisons to other larger resorts. But, the instructor, Jake, we got for our 9 year old in a group and then in a private was excellent. \n\nFood and beverages at the Bierstube were surprisingly reasonable! \n\nAll in all, this ski resort is an excellent value!! Our family would recommend this ski resort!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,4,Mountain operations does a great job daily in getting mountain ready for skiers even when they are short on snow. Fun times for sure
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,4,"Bluebird day. Snow in really good condition. Good in the bierstube good, really super waitress. Love the mountain!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,4,"Even though there wasn't great coverage on the upper mountain, we enjoyed the blue cruisers and mogul filled runs. The base area seemed to get a bit congested and lacked an organized system. We weren't sure if there was a line or where we should wait to get on the lift. Line separators may help with some of the confusion. We will be back as we were able to score some discounted tickets by buying in advance online."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,3,Good mountain for family. A little slick but good. Why isn't there a tubing hill? Really disappointed it doesn't have one as it would be great for families. Need a bigger chalet for hanging out.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,3,Had a great time with the family skiing and snowboarding. Decently priced and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Will go again for sure.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2016,3,"It was windy this particular day, so a bit of the mountain was closed. As always, though, Red Lodge is a great resort. I'm from Billings so it's close, prices are reasonable, and the people are always nice. Great time, despite the weather."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,4,"This place is not a bad ski resort, but a 1 1/2 hour extra drive to Big Sky or Bridger Bowl is worth it in my opinion. I have been going to Red Lodge for at least 15 years and I have to say in those 15 years they haven't upgraded much, they added a yurt at the bottom which in my opinion was a cheap cop out to building another dining area. But that's about it. The triple chair (their main lift) is old and is always stopping, and all other lifts are old double chairs except for the back side and ""bonus area"". Those lifts are high speed quads, which is great except for the fact that those areas aren't even open half the time. Why would a ski area put all the money into something that's not open that much, doesn't make sense. I still like the ski area but every year that goes by without them upgrading anything is another year I will choose to take my family and friends elsewhere."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,3,"Had a good day with the kids, the magic carpet was a little busy at times but not bad. The lines for the lifts were not bad, got right on the chair almost ever time. Just need more snow."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,4,Excellent groomed trails. No lines. Bright sunshine. Spring like conditions. Snow comes by tomorrow with a mild cold front. Pleasant employees.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,4,"Ski here often, lovely local mountain with small town feel and great runs. It's the type of place that has options for all skill levels."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,We are typically people who do not go back to the same vacation place. We love to explore new places. We had such a wonderful time in Red Lodge last year we came back again this year. This ski resort is absolutely wonderful! The people both at the ski resort and in town are so friendly and kind! You feel like you are family. The runs are great and they offer a great time for those that are just learning and for those that can handle the blacks. Pack a lunch or eat in the chalet. Either way be sure to get a chocolate chip cookie...amazing! They also have a wonderful bar for the parents to rest if they get done skiing before the kids!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,5,Unfortunately there was so much ice it was to ski on any of the runs except Miami. We didn't stay all day and paid for the entire day.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,3,"After traveling 900 miles from Minneapolis, I did not expect I would need a tank to navigate their terrible parking lot. Their are holes that you could lose your vehicle in..........terrible."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,3,"Red Lodge is a quaint, family friendly ski resort. There is something for all levels of skiers. The staff are super helpful and pleasant. We have been going to Red Lodge for 5 years and have not been disappointed with our experience. The only variable is the conditions, but they have been good 80% of the time."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,"We were in Billings for something totally different and decided to take our girls skiing at Red Lodge for their first skiing experience. It couldn't have been better. \n\nFirst off, the mountain is a mountain. It's 10K high, so it was everything we had also experienced in Colorado. The instructors were top notch. Very encouraging and friendly with new skiers. Our girls had never skied and were on a lift after 1 hour of great instruction. They fell a few times over the course of the rest of the day, but nothing major and all fun.\n\nThe cost was so reasonable. Way less than what we expected to have to pay. We were debating whether we'd return to Billings for the same event next spring. If we do, we might try and carve out more than one day of skiing since it was such a good experience!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,5,"Staff is great, Nice layout of terrain and good grooming. Adequate snow-making on front side of mountain, but would be much better if they had at least a few trails for each of the Quads that are installed but dependent upon adequate snow coverage. The last few years have really highlighted the necessity."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,5,Just started skiing four weeks ago and I'm hooked! Every staff member I've interacted with has been awesome! Really looking forward to next year so I can try out some bigger runs!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,"Our trip was planned to snowboard March 9, 10, &amp; 11 but when we arrived on the 10th, the power on the mountain was out so no lifts were running. We decided not to wait and find something else in Red Lodge to do. We contacted Liftopia and they offered 20% if you used your ticket or a different date to use a ticket. Unfortunately, we were only scheduled to be there the three days and had purchased the three days. We left out $80 which was frustrating but we had a good time while we were there."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,3,Red Lodge should have compensated for the power outage. Lifts turned on at 11:45. We were among the first to arrive before 9 am.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,3,We had a great day on the mountain with our church youth group. Everyone had fun and the snow was quite good. The Staff were excellent!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2018,5,"Had a great ski day at Red Lodge in February. Mind, the weather was in the 20's with minimum wind--a vast improvement over the negative temps the week before. The parking lot was packed but there is a shuttle. Prices were great. ($49.00 for a half day). Moutain was well groomed. Mannerly people at the sales window and on the slopes. I almost hate saying nice things because although the lot was packed, there were no lines for the lifts. We only did blue and green slopes but they were mostly great. I did get on one that was a passageway between runs. A bit narrow with a small section that was really steep. Still, had one of the most beautiful ski experiences of my life there. Can't wait to go back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2018,5,"The primary lift you have to take up in the morning is an old slow triple prone to breakage. It broke the day before we arrived and we heard people were stuck on the thing in subzero temps for 90 minutes. The lift is wind exposed and is the primary notable weak link of an otherwise great mid-size resort. It's such a sore that even the locals will tell you to ride that lift once a day and then get off of it. It's a shame as there is some nice terrain accessible from the lift that we chose to ignore except for our run down at the end of the day.\n\nOn the other hand, the Grizzly Peak old slow double is perfectly suited for where it is located. It is not a critical lift that you have to ride, and the time it takes to go up is fair for the length of the runs. No problem here. Downside is some of the nicest runs require you to finish up all the way at the base area and then you'd have to take up the POS triple again. No thanks.\n\nThey have a high speed detachable quad called Palisades which runs as a very slow speed quad. It makes no sense. We asked the lift attendant if something was wrong and he said it was actually a high speed lift ""but this is as fast as management chooses to run it."" So that was also a kick in the jewels and kept us off otherwise nice blue terrain. It was too cold to sit on that slow lift.\n\nThe shining star of the resort is the Coal Creek high speed quad. That runs at normal speed, serves epic terrain, and you can do laps on the thing all day and be entertained. Had a lot of fun off that lift,\n\nAlso enjoyed both the mid-lodge and the Stube at the bottom of the hill. Friendly ski bar with fine food, friendly bartenders and fair prices. We enjoyed the soup of the day, chili, pretzels, beers and bloodys. \n\nLook forward to coming back to the resort, but it's a shame about the Triple chair which I also don't recall having a safety bar. Being old and accident prone, it'd certainly be nice if it as least had a bar for a family friendly resort."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2018,4,"After 18 years, it was time to get back into skiing and have my 12 year old take lessons. Glad we went! Miami Beach was a wonderful beginner run (a little steep on part) but not crowded. Would definitely do the 2 hour private lesson again."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2018,4,"I took 2 private lessons. The first was great, the second time around my 1.5 hour lesson started 10 min late and ended 5 min early. Disappointing on such a short lesson"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2018,3,"I have skied 50 years. Started in Michigan in the 60's. Since then I have skied alll of Colorado ,parts of Utah and Tahoe. Stood in line a lot. Red Lodge is the quintessential ski resort. Low key , needs more quads lifts but harkens back to a time when you could take your family skiing and not go broke. Nice long runs , fast cruisers, moguls if you want. No Lines ! Walk to the parking lot bring your grille and cook out for lunch. Not a big resort at almost 17000 acres but big enough and similar to many smaller Colorado resorts. I love Vail and the back bowls but if you are near Billings and want a really nice day of skiing at a fair price go to Red Lodge. The town is perfect Western also ,low key and casual."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2017,4,"Great prices, great skiing, very short lift lines. We enjoyed 2 days of skiing here. Our kids took lessons and got their first taste of skiing. The instructors were friendly. Not sure I'd rent our ski equipment at the mountain though. The ""cashier"" made us fill out paperwork twice (unnecessarily, we came to find out), tried to charge us twice, and didn't seem to know (or maybe care about) what he was doing. I'd recommend renting equipment in town for cheaper prices and more knowledgeable staff. Other than that, we enjoyed our time at RLM."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2017,4,"Short lift lines, great snow conditions, and killer trails makes RLM our favorite! The trails offer lots of variety for family members with differing abilities yet the mountain is small enough that it's easy to meet up again--say for hot cocoa at the mid-mountain lodge. \n\nSerious skiers won't be disappointed with incredible glades and amazing expert-only areas away from the beginners. For the more cautious skier in your family, try the wide open Miami Beach or Turnpike. All of the runs offer stunning views/vistas of the Montana plains looking north toward Billings. Bring your camera! \n\nFood offerings are solid from the burritos and draft beer at the mid-mountain lodge to the appetizers and cocktails at the Bierstube. We recommend taking a pass on the cafeteria in the main lodge on the weekends--it's small and crowded and tricky to walk around in your ski boots--too many stairs.\n\nAs a three-generation family visiting for three days during the busy Christmas/New Year holiday week, we loved every minute and the mountain never felt crowded. The town of Red Lodge offers great hotels (the Pollard) and restaurants (Carbon County Steak House). Do your family a favor and skip the madness of the mega-ski resort and ski where there is something for the whole family and small enough that you can all see each other during the day."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2017,4,My 12 year old tried snow boarding for the first time. He said the lesson was very informative. He was able to do it on his own and be confident by the end of the day. The rental and lift ticket and lesson purchase was a little frustrating but got through it.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2017,4,"RL continues to offer a nice variety of runs, friendly &amp; helpful staff and great cheese fries! Affordable skiing without the lines and hassle. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area. We drive from MN annually to ski here - it’s our favorite!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2017,5,"Timed our visit perfectly for visiting on opening weekend. 3"" of fresh powder fell in cold temps the night before we went up the mountain. We drove a front wheel drive economy rental up without too much trouble although extreme caution was necessary driving on snow packed road without guard rails. Short lift ticket line and small sky shop were welcoming. Nice selection of runs open and lift lines were non-existent. Overall a nice place to ski."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,5,"Drainage and coal chute were epic! Plenty of snow, fun staff, and fantastic trail conditions. Can't wait to go back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,"The 1st day was amazing, however given the age of the mountain/resort I'd hope for high speed lifts for their primary lifts up the mountain, not on the smaller runs on the back side of the mountain as it is here. It's very frustrating when the lift takes longer to get up than it does to ski down the mountain. \n\nThe prices are reasonable as well as the rentals for my children. The design of the lodge and access to the lifts is a bit difficult being you have to walk UP a steep hill in ski boots to get to the kids bunny slop and any of the ski lifts. This is a huge challenge for the new skiers who aren't use to walking in ski boots. It took my son 10 minutes just to get up hill to the lift! Ultimately this is just a poor design which won't change being it's built :( If your new to the mountain this would be a nice heads up! \n\nMost of the staff was very nice as well. I'd love to see them put in at least two new high speed lifts though!!! I have skied all over the U.S and in other countries as well, so I do have a good compassion to the other types of mountains."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,4,"My family has season passes to Red Lodge Mountain and have for a few years now. The hill is great for all types of skills. My snowboarder son loves the terrain park. The staff is awesome and so welcoming! Just a great, friendly place!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,5,"We chose Red Lodge over Big Sky and for a number of reasons, I'm so glad we did. Prices were affordable and the trails were great for a beginner like me."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,5,"Awesome that all the lifts were open. it was the best skiing at Red Lodge in a long time. Snow is great, lots of runs open."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,4,RLM is so fun and the staff is very friendly. Can't wait to go again. Love to stop for beers at the mid lodge and at the Bierstube.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,4,The community is very friendly and the sites are amazing. Our rented house worked out better than expected for us.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,3,We had a great time skiing. Fresh powder both days. Meet lots of fun people. We will be back next year.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,3,"14 inches of new snow! short lift lines, very helpful staff. good lessons for the young ones, and great hard runs for the more experienced skiers in our group. very good overall 2 days on the mountain!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,4,Wonderful friendly mountain that is accessible and affordable. There is terrain for every level of skier and lift tickets only cost me $40 a day when ordered from the red lodge Web site! We will be back thank you red lodge!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr 2016,2,"So this part of the country has super unpredictable snow. Was a terrible season for Red Lodge, but they got this late season storm (after they closed for the season) that brought 55"" of really wet snow, so they reopened the first week of April with super cheap lift ticket prices, so we went. Had an absolute blast. My girlfriend grew up on the east coast and hates powder skiing (I know, I know, it's a point of contention in our relationship... haha) so even though there was a lot of snow, the heaviness made it more like groomed skiing. I though there was a good variety of runs (granted only half the mountain was open) and it felt like pretty good access. The snow was super sticky, but we had a blast. I can see where the skiing can be rough with little snow though. The mid mountain lodge was great with good beer specials and the perfect location really. The rental shop was very efficient and the pricing was reasonable. I really hope they can have more low price ticket days to attract people from the region. My only 2 complaints were that the retail shop was very disappointing, granted end of the season, but they didn't even appear to sell skies or anything besides some socks and sweatshirts. And The road up to the mountain is a little rough with some bad potholes. There were survey stakes all the way up though, so I would assume this is getting remedied this summer."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2016,4,"Skied with multiple family members for three days at the end of March, mid-week plus Saturday. The property was well maintained and served our family of first-time to out-of-practice-mellow skiers/boarders well; not sure what it's like for more experienced/aggressive skiers. My 12 yr old son took a beginner snowboarder lesson with Ryan, he was excellent: patient and friendly, and he had my son off of the ""magic carpet"" and riding the beginner slopes before the end of the lesson. Best of all there were NO crowds, even on Saturday the longest lift line we experienced was only 4 people deep, and the staff/crew were all super friendly. The surrounding town of Red Lodge was only minutes away and offered plenty of places to eat/drink/shop. Would love to come back next winter."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2016,5,"We had two families, four adults and four kids (14, 13, and two 12 year olds). The skiing was absolutely wonderful! Great runs from beginner to way advanced! No lines for two days...Saturday before Easter there were some lines but they went super fast and the most you waited was a couple minutes. People of RL were super friendly! Recommend bringing your own lunches but be sure to pick up the super big cookies at the lodge ... The kids loved them!!! (I am sure the RL food was good...but save some more $$ on bringing your own and much healthier.). Bring a roll of quarters for the lockers. We rented from the ski station in town. We also bought lift tickets on the RL web page...we ordered them each day around 4:30-5pm. Great deals. Couldn't believe how ridiculously cheat the skiing was. Fantastic family vacation!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2016,4,"We live in Billings, Montana which is about an hour drive from Red Lodge Mountain. We enjoy skiing here because it is close and affordable. The total snow fall by year is unpredictable so we don't buy season passes but we have bought 6-tix to save on the daily lift ticket costs. Unfortunately this year we did not time the use of our 6-tix and we only were able to use 3 of the 6 tickets. The resort decided to close 2 weeks early because of the lack of snow fall and like many years, the best snow fell in the last week that they were open with this early close date. \n\nPutting that aside, which is nature's fault not the fault of the administration, we LOVE skiing Red Lodge. There are 3 places to eat; the Main Lodge which allows you to bring your own food; the Bierstube which is more of an adult atmosphere with a patio for warmer days; and Midway which also has a patio for warmer days and is open Friday - Sundays. The food is nothing fancy and the prices are resort prices but the atmosphere is always fun and the staff are ALWAYS very cheerful and happy to be there. \n\nThis is definitely a resort that welcomes children. There is a ""Magic Carpet"" for beginners and beginner lessons. Miami Beach is also an excellent place for your young ones to get experience skiing. This year the back side was not open when we were there because there was not enough snow but the Triple Chair lift from the bottom easily accesses the Midway Lodge from where you can catch a nearby Grizzly Peak chair that takes you to both black diamond and blue runs or you can ski down green runs from Midway using Turnpike (easy wide slope), Bobcat and a few others. The Triple Chair lift is a 7 minute ride and the ski down is 3-5 minutes depending on your experience level. \n\nIt seems there are often racing events on the weekends which adds to the frivolity of the mountain. There is also a course for snowboarders and skiers to practice their jumps. \n\nAll around good times in a friendly Montana local. I just wish they had more predictable snow."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2016,4,"We love RLM! We have enjoyed a family ski trip annually since 2003! It is affordable, there is enough terrain for every level of skier and the community of Red Lodge is charming-great amenities! Check to see if ""The Palisades"" is open-RLM gets late spring snow. You usually can't go wrong with this destination for family fun!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,4,We had a really great time. Even with little snow this winter the rubs were nice and groomed. Some of the lifts weren't open but the youth group still had a blast. They really liked the jumps in the terrain park. They also liked watching the racers. The lodge is nice and friendly workers. We will be planning to come again next year. Thanks for a fun youth trip.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2015,4,WE went snowboarding with the family and had a blast. They are all willing to help and very friendly. We have been here twice and love it every time we visit Montana
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,5,"Good, despite really poor snow this year. I'd go again, I love the free under 5 and free magic carpet for teaching our kids. I didn't really get to do many harder runs for that reason, but I look forward to it. Poor snow this year, and I wish the lift tickets would reflect that difficulty with access. The Lodge is kind of ridiculously overpriced and uncomfortable."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,3,"Loved Red Lodge Mountain &amp; all employees were so friendly! Our grandchildren ages 7,8, &amp; 4 years old all took ski lessons, there first time ever skiing! Instructors were great &amp; kids skiied like they have been skiing forever, adults had lessons too &amp; learned so much, forever grateful for all the wonderful memories!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2016,2,The Good:\nEvery employee was friendly and helpful. They seemed genuinely glad we were there. We rented equipment and it was in good condition. The mountain has a little something for every level of skier. We come to ski Red lodge from California to get away from the crowds and the cost is reasonable for our family of five. \nThe Bad:\nRed Lodge was having unseasonably warm weather and not much snow. The groomed runs were fine for us beginners though. \nThe Ugly:\nMy son hit a tree and broke his leg! The ski patrol did an absolutely amazing job putting him in a traction splint and getting him off the mountain. I can't thank them enough for their professionalism and expertise. When we were completely helpless they took over and got us to safety. \n\nWe will ski Red Lodge again. I highly recommend wearing a helmet and staying away from the trees!\n
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,5,The snow was great but we sat in the lodge until 11:30 waiting for the power to come on. We got 20% of our money refunded but sat nearly half the day. I think a half day pass would been better. We haven't been up for 2 years and were considering a season pass next year. Not sure now
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,5,"We took the young boys on two separate days, they are 9 and 7 years old. We bought the tickets online which was a nice savings. We went during the middle of the week, it was not crowded at all, we never waited in a line. The second day the quad chair was open and we really liked those runs. The chair lift is wonderful, it slows down to get on and is fast and then the run is longer. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We went on the triple chair and it loads quite fast, but they slowed it down for us, which was nice. The runs were well groomed, they had gotten some new snow. The only reason it is a 4 star, is that I wish there were a few more healthy food choices in the main lodge and maybe not quite so expensive. The nice thing is that you can bring your own lunch if you want."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,5,Had a great day on the mountain. Staff was friendly and efficient. It only took minutes to get my son's rental skis fitted and out the door. The slopes were great and we skied the whole mountain. Plenty or runs to suit the needs of all skiers. We always have a good time at RLM.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,"I've been coming out to Red Lodge Mountain for years now and I must say, this place is awesome! The skiing is great and the people are fantastic. It is not Montana's biggest or most luxurious skiing, in fact I stop very short of calling it ""resort"" but it is real skiing for real skiers who want a great place to ski, eat, drink, and relax with thier families! Can't wait to come back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,"We have been coming, for our annual Ski Trip, to Red Lodge to Ski for over 35 years. Our children grew up skiing Red Lodge Mountain and now our Grandchildren. We Love It. Nothing better than Skiing with your kids and now both our Kids and Grandchildren Thank You Gary &amp; Debbie"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,"A hop, skip and jump from my residence in Billings. The mountain is steep and full of fun pow-stashes when the snow is going and the winds are calmer. Easy going and helpful staff. Excellent bat staff and beer selection. Good music too! The locals are the best part! Prices for tickets are very reasonable so this makes Red Lodge a saught after MT ski destination for all age groups and families. Shred on!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,3,"Great weather, friendly staff. Beautiful sunny day l. Lots of activities. 90s big air competition was fun. Nothing like sun, cut off jeans and spread eagles!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,We had a great time at Red Lodge Mountain. The snow was great and no lift lines. All the staff were very friendly and helpful.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,"Great skiing, friendly staff, nice facility. Red Lodge exceeded our expectations, we will definitely be back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,5,We hit the powder jackpot! Great three days of skiing. Red Lodge has a great staff of friendly people and the town is just as hospitable!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul 2017,3,We drove up to the mountain. It was a gorgeous day and the views were wonderful. I imagine it is a great place to ski in the winter.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jul 2017,3,As a novice skier I enjoy the ease of riding down Miami Beach. The staff has been friendly and helpful every time we have been there. \nThe snowboarding lessons for our son were extremely helpful and affordable. They showed kindness and patience with him which made the rest of the trip even more enjoyable.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jun 2017,3,"Found it.......perfection. \nAmericans need to see this place as classic USA small town beauty and charm. 2200 residents but the town has it all.....mountain beauty, skiing, outdoor everything, at least one parade a month, gateway to Yellowstone via "" America's most beautiful drive""....according to Charles Kuralt."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,May 2017,3,"We stayed at the Red Lodge Inn in Red Lodge Montana. Daniel &amp;Tiffany are the owners, and they are very accomodating, and the rooms are very clean. We will stay there again in the near future."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,May 2017,3,"From Billings, MT to Red Lodge town (56 miles) you will see the gateway to Yellowstone Park with wonderful and unbelievable views, by Beartooth highway! Trees, snow, ice, bears! The place is unforgettable!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr 2017,4,Stopped by and enjoyed the bar and the view. The weather was not very good as it was snowing and blowing but still a good look.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr 2017,5,"This resort has something for everyone. The groomers made for ""hero"" skiing, the off piste challenging and fun, and the knee deep powder a welcomed treat in April! We appreciated the vibe, beer and food in the beer stube where we finished our day."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Mar 2017,4,Great time and our lodging at the Cornerview was awesome! We had excellent rates at the ski resort which allowed us to take our younger grandchildren skiing The ski slopes were well groomed and our group had super days skiing. The people are all very friendly and the eating places were very welcoming. Great vacation!!!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr 2017,5,We boarded Sunday and Monday. Fresh powder both days and no busy lines. Everyone was friendly. Loved it as always!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Apr 2017,2,"We had a fantastic day April 1st on our way home. We were going to ski Big Sky again but the snow looked good at Red Lodge and wanted to try it. The conditions were exactly as reported and it was the best day we had all week! It is so much north facing that the steep trees were deep powder still even on a warm day. The open slopes were fine, too. It was late afternoon before it got sticky. There were no rocks anywhere. Staff was great, online tickets saved us a bunch of money compared to the big places, food good at the midway lodge. Only complaint, and this is lame, is that we had to walk up several flights of stairs after we parked because we got there late on a powder day Saturday and the lot was full. The triple is a little long and slow but Cole Creek was a great lift and all are comfortable. Plenty of mix of terrain for all of us to ski together most of the time, intermediate to advanced. Definitely worth trying for a couple days this season yet."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,2,icy Way to expensive. For what you get. If I had to do it again I would have went to Bridger bowl.for about the same money.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,4,My first time there. I just moved to the area but I was impressed with the mountain . I came here from Colorado so I am hard to please.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,3,"Has better runs than found on the east and Midwest, especially for he price. There are NO lift lines."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,3,"We like to hit the slopes here for a day, get-away. The drive is fairly short from Billings and the scenery is nice year round. The skiing conditions are really good this year, other than the warmer days of late causing some crust on the dust."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,4,I have been skiing this mountain since I was a kid. It never gets old and it's always a great time. The food is good and the staff is awesome. Plus you gotta love no lift lines.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,4,"We love Red Lodge. We've had beginners for awhile with three kids and the magic carpet is always the first stop. I love the option for a Malibu lift ticket only for the upgrade. The kids have a ball. This weekend's snow was perfect - you can't get better than Montana/Wyoming powder. Its got great options, great variety, great value. I'm a fan!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,4,"We found this place by accident, and it was a great find! \n\nThere is terrain for all levels of skiing. The lifts are a bit slow but that didn't take away from the day's fun!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Feb 2017,3,"Great day. Haven't been to the mountain for over 20 years, just moved back to Billings. In our 50's, but think it's time to get back into it. People at the rental shack were great, mountain looks in good shape. We'll be back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Dec 2016,5,"Always love skiing RL! large enough for experienced skiers, but small enough that I can take the kids to have fun."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge Mountain,Jan 2017,4,"We had a fantastic time. Loved the variety and friendly people! Although the snow was thin this early in the season, we managed to see most of the ski hill. We certainly hope to be back soon. Loved the town and got great deals on lift tickets. This ski resort has lots to offer for everyone at any skiing ability."
