Tripadvisor,Snowbowl Ski,January 2018,5,"We stayed one night in a deluxe double room with private bath. This is the most affordable slopeside lodging I've seen anywhere - we paid $64, and it also came with a $6 discount on the daily lift ticket. Online booking requires 3 days notice, which we didn't have - tried calling and emailing, finally talked to a guy at the ski shop, he said just come on up before the ski area closes. We got there around 2pm and the ticket office took care of us. We were the only people staying in the lodge on a Tuesday night. It's got a nice outdoor hot tub. If you want dinner, the pub next door is open till 6:30pm, so act early. Then everybody but you goes home, and it's very peaceful until the groomers get started around 1:00am - but they head up into the hills, so didn't really bother us.; The room was basic but warm and just what we needed. And the skiing was great the next morning, with the lift just steps from our door.; â€¦"
Tripadvisor,Snowbowl Ski,June 2017,5,"I have called three times now trying to ask one simple question about the zip line. The voice mail systerm doesn't seem to work - whatever button you press takes you somewhere random. The system hangs up on you if you press the same button twice. When I finally got to the voice mail box for ""Gia"" it said, ""We hardly ever check this voice mail."" If they can bother to answer the phone or even check voice mail I can't imagine that they would provide good service or safe equipment."
Tripadvisor,Snowbowl Ski,March 2017,3,"If proximity to Missoula is your only consideration, Snowbowl is the perfect ski area. If any semblance of pride in ownership matters, don't look too closely at the filthy, unstocked bathrooms, old food ground into the carpet, unpleasant owner or consideration of annual pass holders. Even the new locker/changing room downstairs is half finished, dirty, and unwelcoming. The slopes are kept well groomed, sort of, but go to any other ski area in Montana and you'll notice the difference. No lift lines during the week and the coffee isn't half bad."
Tripadvisor,Snowbowl Ski,February 2016,4,"Great little ski resort, over 2000 feet of vertical terrain, getting another new lift this year. Can get icy at times and busy on the weekends. Flagstaff is a great town away from the busy city life of Phoenix."
Tripadvisor,Snowbowl Ski,January 2016,4,We skied on a weekday and there were no lift lines. Runs were in great condition. A fun ski area for all abilities. Check out the stay free deals if you need lodging in Flagstaff. Would recommend to all!
