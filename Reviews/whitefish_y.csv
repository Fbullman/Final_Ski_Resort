Y,1,Whitefish,Liza S.,California,7/18/21,5,"Perfect way to spend a summer day as a family.  Our two boys 5/7 loved it and so did the grown ups!  Our younger son was too young to join on the ropes course but there was plenty to do while they waited. The staff was helpful and informative and it was a challenging and fun thing for us to do!
We love the alpine slide and tubing!  It's a little pricier than most local activities (about $200 for 4 people), but would definitely recommend!"
Y,2,Whitefish,Jeff M.,Rhode Island,1/20/21,5,"Have nothing but great things to say about the staff at the Mountain Bike Center here at Whitefish Mountain.  The checkin process was clean and efficient, sized us up and had us out on what looked to be brand new bikes in just a few minutes.  

And the resort was well equipped for our excursion.  Lots of terrain, with easy lift access, and plenty of help getting up on the chair for the 1st time.  

I do have a bit to say about that 1st time.  Although I've biked a bit before, I had never been to a mountain to do so.  I expected, not without some cause, that there would be a variety of terrain options.  Just like a ski setup, easy Green stuff, Blue intermediate stuff, and Black Diamond hard core.  And on the trail map, there was.

It was a bit of a surprise that there was not a complete run of Easy terrain that was easy to access.  There was some mild stuff, but you could not connect, even from the rental parking lot, a circuit route with a lift that had a Green loop.  

Second surprise.  Green, well that wasn't quite so easy.  If you aren't a fairly competent off road bike rider, the easy stuff was still a pretty good challenge.  

Surprise number three.  Taking the easiest way down from the summit, that's 12.6 miles.  Ask me how I know.  

I had a pretty great time, especially before I fell off the bike.  Story for another day.  Good spot, lots of fun, but it ain't easy."
Y,3,Whitefish,Richard B.,Canada,1/25/21,5,"After snowboarding in 3 different locations in Montana. Whitefish resort is the gem of Montana. This resort gets an insane amount of snow. There's so much powder here, it's heaven. I have never snowboarded in better conditions. Just straight gliding, and when you fall it doesn't hurt cuz ur falling on powder. If you go to the top of the mountain you can snowboard between a plethora of whited out trees. My jesus, the trees are absolutely beautiful, they are completed whited out, you can't see any green. As you come down the mountain you can see the lake, awesome scenery here.

I was able to board for $73 for all day on a weekday. Amazing price, amazing location. I will definitely come back. The lifts are fast and safe. It definitely gets cold here so bundle up.

For the price and scenery of this place, it's absolutely gorgeous, highly recommend you come here for ski season. Can't wait to come back."
Y,4,Whitefish,Della L.,New York,2/23/21,3,"Beautiful views and ski runs.  Was quite cloudy with low visibility and icy ski conditions at times, especially when using chair lift #1. Must take blue runs to get to green trails if taking lift #1 & #2. Stayed at Edelweiss with nice views, kitchenette and hot tub. Snow bus also a nice perk to go into town.
A few concerns with the workers at the resort. One of the ski lift workers had gloves that said 'inspired to be a dirt bag'. Dan in the base lodge rental area was very rude when we asked about our ski pass not working at night (the 3day pass says nothing about night skiing being excluded from the pass). Lastly, on Sunday when standing in line waiting for ski lift #1 to open, an off-duty youth ski instructor from the resort was in line next to us (Isiah S. from NC) was making threats towards the tourists, saying 'is tourist season open yet? Can we start shooting them yet? When are these chickens gonna fly back to their coop?' He was also threatening to throw coins at people's helmets and had a laser that he was pointing in people's eyes.He was very loud and obnoxious and made sure everyone knew he was an employee at the resort. He even was purposely standing on the back of our skiis. NOT cool.
They are also big sticklers with face masks, even though the state  has lifted the mandatory use. Face masks even needed to be worn outside.
It was good trip, but had better experiences at Big Sky, Keystone, Breckenridge, and Copper Mt."
Y,5,Whitefish,Tara H.,California,8/21/21,1,Staff training recommended- save yourself the frustration.
Y,6,Whitefish,Morgan F.,Pennsylvania,4/19/21,2,Lodging- morning eagle. Easy access to ski lift. Amenities were dated. Limited local dining spots.
Y,7,Whitefish,Lilie X.,Washington,8/17/20,5,Went zip lining for the first time and Quinn and Hunter did an amazing job making it unforgettable! The zip lines were super fun and everywhere we went there was a beautiful view! 10/10 would recommend going zip lining here.
Y,8,Whitefish,Julie B.,Texas,7/19/20,5,"Lots of fun summer activities; tube slide, chair lift, alpine slide and gondola ride.  Beautiful place too. One of my favorite places in Whitefish."
Y,9,Whitefish,Ed M.,Florida,6/17/19,5,"While we are staying in the Whitefish area we decided to head up to Big Mountain and take the lift ride to the top. After a  scenic drive up the mountain we arrived at the lodge and boarded the chair lift to the top. The ride was great and the views of the mountain side were amazing. From hi king trails to mountain bike trailed, we saw them all. Once we got to the top the view was breathtaking. Pictures don't do it justice. It is well worth the $17.00 each. We had a choice from the chair lift or an enclosed gondola. The chair lift was for me.  On the way down you could see the lake and the town. The sights were amazing. If you are in Whitefish y'all need to do this. It was well worth the money."
Y,10,Whitefish,Camille R.,Illinois,8/24/20,5,"Went on August 7, 2020. Alpine lift and alpine slide were fun! Also dropped my card/id while on the lift up from the bottom of the alpine slide and I believe an employee named Aaron took the time to pick it up for me even though they were busy. Glad he did because I would have not been able to board the plane back to Chicago without my ID the next day. Thanks dude, you rock!"
Y,11,Whitefish,Royce F.,California,2/16/20,5,"Great resort with unique features similar to that of other high elevations mountains. Friendly people all over the place.

Purchased skis after demo rentals from the village rental shop, Dave was an excellent and knowledgeable employee who made everything happen. Will always be buying my skis here!"
Y,12,Whitefish,Selena N.,Oregon,7/26/19,4,"Stayed here as a result of an airbnb not working out. So we had to drive to Glacier National Park every day, but all didn't mind. It was a very clean, nice lodge. Great value! Hot showers, and comfortable bed. The kitchen was somewhat well equipped. For the life of me though, I wish that there had been a better sponge to clean up the kitchen.  A scrubber and paper towels don't do it!  It was a nice place though overall for all of us to stay! May go back here for ski season, for it isn't unreasonable for a group to stay here."
Y,13,Whitefish,Dawn G.,Washington,12/3/18,4,"We are lift assisted downhill mountain biking fans and this resort lives up to the hype!   We were able to park our camper in the lot overnight and get on the first lifts up the mountain for day of fun riding, crazy crashes, excellent views, and good beverages at the summit lodge.  The lifts are quick and efficient and take you to the top where you can choose your skill level of ride down.  All the trails are well marked and maintained.  We visited on a weekday so I do not have a good feel for how busy it can get, on a weekday it was great!  I hope to return again soon for more summer riding...or some winter skiing!"
Y,14,Whitefish,Sean D.,Montana,1/1/20,1,"Worst lift line corrals in the business, and now they're ripping off locals for parking. They won't stay open past tourist season because the tourists go away, and you always have to worry about plowing an uphill skier in the fog."
Y,15,Whitefish,Paige A.,Arizona,6/23/17,4,"This place has summer fun for the whole family. My friends and I went for zip lining- a two hour tour on top of the mountain. It was a great time for everyone with incredible views. They also have a scenic lift, children's mountain bike trail, and an alpine slide. Bar, cafe, and a cafeteria are all also in the base lodge.

Zip lining was $55/person. They also have a photographer taking shots throughout and are available for purchase at the end of your tour.

The lodge also has great wi fi available for those that might have some work to get done or just want to save some data."
Y,16,Whitefish,Diane B.,Minnesota,9/16/19,5,We loved Whitefish.  We were there for a destination wedding and it was phenomenal.  Everything was perfect.  Accommodations were wonderful.   Lots of activities.  Food was great.   Wedding planner was amazing.   We had a great time and will be back.
Y,17,Whitefish,Jean H.,Illinois,3/7/19,4,"Awesome resort. My daughter and I had a fabulous time at the spa, restaurants, hot tubs and atmosphere. Only issue was the condo we stayed in was not up to par with the resort. I was told the condos are owned and run by the owners so it was run down. I would highly recommend staying in the main hotel. And we went at Christmas time and the decor was awesome"
Y,18,Whitefish,Joanna P.,California,8/11/18,5,"What a great place for families to spend time! We came here in the summer and spent whole day at the resort. We did great short hike at the top of the mountain. Check out the nature room at the bottom of the building at the top of the mountain.  Kids ( 6 and 9) loved the alpine slide ( we did few runs), aerial adventure park and tubing. Lunch place at the base of the mountain had surprisingly good quality and tasty food ( tuna salad sandwich and watermelon salad were delicious!). Overall a must place to visit when traveling with kids!"
Y,19,Whitefish,Wade H.,California,2/14/20,3,"Great mountain, small lift line, snow ghosts, (relatively) reasonably priced lift tickets and lodge food. Unfortunately, the ski rentals at the base lodge were a major detraction. My girlfriend is a beginner and our experience was abominable. The girl ""helping"" us got our rental form, grabbed some boots, dropped them in front of my girlfriend and walked away. Fortunately I worked is ski shops in my 20's and knew how to fit boots so I made sure her size was correct, switched her insoles and got her fit and properly buckled. The guy who got her skis asked no questions, just checked her boot sole size and handed her skis with no explanation. The skis were dry but ok and I made sure her poles were the correct size which they didn't bother to do. I don't know if it's poor management, poor training or just ambivalence about the job from gen z young adults but I remember when customer service and caring about helping new skiers in a sport that workers are passionate about was a thing. I would recommend the Sportsman and Ski Haus in Whitefish, they seem to have a better reputation, better prices and certainly couldn't be any worse, I don't think that is possible."
Y,20,Whitefish,Katie S.,Arizona,7/21/18,5,"Family-fun day spent on Whitefish Mountain. We took our two girls (3 & 5) down the slide. The line was about 30 minutes long, but both girls loved it. We then went up the gondola for the scenic view and lunch. My husband and I were both blown away by how delicious our sandwiches were. I highly recommend the turkey burger and the emu burger. Very fun day!"
Y,21,Whitefish,Kirstie B.,Texas,1/17/20,5,"This is a reply to Sean D, one star review. To clarify on the parking: There are multiple parking lots on at the base lodge that are free FREE. There are three lots in the village,  two are pay lots. $5 & $10. There is also a FREE shuttle service with many stops around town. I think its important to clarify bc its irresponsible to leave a review like that. Doesn't help anyone visiting.  No clue with what his issue is with the lift ques.  They are organized. Regarding uphill skiers, what us the difference between an uphill skier and any downhill skier, NOTHING.  it's an object in the way to be avoided by the uphill skier as you would with anything else downhill, a snowboarder sitting, a tree, ANYTHING. And the fog is the fog so follow the orange dots."
Y,22,Whitefish,Meg P.,Washington,9/5/16,1,"Don't waste your time or money!! We booked a zip and stay package for our honeymoon and drove 600 miles and 2 states to do this. When we checked in the man at the Kintla lodge check in desk was horribly rude. Our room was ok, small with a queen bed but otherwise fine. They have a tiny hot tub that closes at 10pm and didn't re-open until 10 am. It smelled like rotten eggs

The zip tour had been rescheduled because of weather, which is awesome that they called and gave us a heads up. Luckily we opted for the refund and my husband was going to just book the next day if weather would cooperate.

When we woke up for the 10 am check out (really 10 am? Too early) the weather was better so we packed up, checked out to get a coffee next door at the village coffee shop. We literally walked up between 10:00 and 10:01 and the girl just looked at us and looked away talking to her boyfriend who was sucking down some drink. Apparently the stupid coffee shop closed at 10. Horrible that she didn't even try to say sorry we just closed or even point to the darn sign!

Next try was to go to the coffee shop at base lodge where he was going to do the zip line. We parked and got in there and couldn't find an open coffee shop, was passed by no less then 8 staff while looking. Not one of them would even help. When we walked by the mountain excursion room and the zip line check in every employee was staring blankly and not one of them were any help.

We left. Completely disappointed in our experience with this whole resort!! (Katie and Suzanne you are the only nice ones) Worst staff ever! Everywhere we went staff just treated us like we were putting them out by even being there. Both my husband and I have worked in many different roles with customer service and just cringe at this resort. Never has it been so hard to spend our money somewhere!!"
Y,23,Whitefish,Tom B.,California,1/3/16,4,"Where to start. This place is amazing. I rented a snoWboard and helmet. The price is just right! The lift ticket however for a half day is a little spendy.

The runs are amazing. The staff seemed amazing. The beer is cold, the people are friendly and the lift waits are short! I'll definitely be coming back"
Y,24,Whitefish,Laura N.,California,3/20/16,5,"My boys ski, but I don't. They are loving the slopes. I'm hanging at the lodge at the top of the mountain. $18 gets you a foot passenger ticket up the lift. The lodge on top is full-service, with a bustling bar with local brews on tap. Heart-stopping views from up top! The bar/cafeteria area upstairs is crowded and a bit noisy. If you want quiet, go to the lower floor. Still great views, you can take your drink & food down there, and you might be the only ones down there. We shared some curly fries and they were surprisingly good, crispy and served with good ranch dressing for dipping. This is the nicest ski lodge to hang out in!"
Y,25,Whitefish,Rick W.,Colorado,7/22/19,4,"Great mountain. Excellent hiking and biking trails. Greedy, though, to charge for downhill access on the lift--the chairs are running anyway, so if a guest has hiked up you should allow free rides down. And what's with the lack of water at the Summit House? Not even a drinking fountain? You can do better!"
Y,26,Whitefish,Will C.,Washington,3/14/13,3,"his review is mixed and is more relevant to those traveling to the resort via Amtrak.

-- On mountain staff: 5 stars --
The staff here is amazing.  Super friendly and helpful.  My 9 yr old daughter kept saying throughout the day ""everyone is so friendly here"".   I had a lift operator come out of nowhere and offer to take a photo of me with my camera.  The ski instructors are great with children and after her first two hour lesson she was a much more confident skier and exchanging high fives with her instructor.

-- Wait times: 5 stars --
We stayed at Whitefish over a holiday weekend, MLK day, and they were also holding a big race.  It was their busiest weekend of the year and the longest line was only 10 minutes.   Most of the lifts are a minute or less, and some with no lines.

You can easily find runs that you will have almost to yourself.  The people at Whitefish are mostly locals or Canadian (no Europeans like at Whistler) and so it's a very low key atmosphere and people are courteous to each other.

-- Ski in Ski out: 3 stars --
The resort advertises ski in ski out access from their hotels and rental properties.  The ski out is super easy for both snow boarders and skiers.  However skiing back in is a challenge, especially with children.  In order to ski back in you have to traverse the lifts all the way to skiers right, and then take a fairly tough blue run to a long, fairly flat cat track.  There are no signs to tell you where you are going and we made a couple mistakes that required hiking back to the correct turn.

For you last run if the day it's brutal with children.  Adults that can ski blues well and have a good sense of direction will fair better.  This could be easily improved with some more signage and curing a green run higher up the mountain.

-- Other Activities: 2 stars --
We were attracted to Whitefish because they advertised activities like dogsledding and sleigh rides.  However, these activities are far from the resort and they are not supported with a regular shuttle service.  Dog sledding is 30 miles away and unless you have a large group and are going on a Tuesday, the you will need to pay for a cab - $50 each way.   Slight riding is only available to groups if 6 or more, so a family of 4 or a couple is out if luck.  

It's ridiculous - Whitefish needs to improve their shuttle service if they are going to market traveling by train.

-- Snow: 3 stars --
As of The third week in January, coverage isn't great.  There are bald spots all over the lower mountain.   It is nothing like Cascades in Washington where coverage is deep by January.  However, since it is very cold in Montana, the quality if the snow is great and hold up well.   We had no new snow our entire stay but it held up well to grooming and stayed fluffy (although packed down) off trail."
Y,27,Whitefish,Joel M.,Arizona,5/17/18,5,I worked here this winter and grew up in the area. After going other places I realize what a gem this place is... smart layout of the runs and lots of quality snow... of course this mountain is known for its fog but is what it is... keeps the crowds away...
Y,28,Whitefish,Tina W.,Washington,7/24/16,4,"Zip line was awesome!  Our guide was excellent with us, as we had an autistic tween with us qho doesnt do well with big groups. We had a small grouo and were able to bypass a large group that was ahead of us. PIctures the photographer took of our group was excellent,  rates average for the area.

Two  downsides of our afternoon was the lobby actually. It is loud and echoed quite a bit, making it not only difficult to hear the staff at the check in counter, but was a majorly sensory overload for our tween child.
The second was zipline was the only activity OPEN when we arrived! We had planned a treetop walk, so a couple people in our group sat out as they couldn't zipline due to back problems."
Y,29,Whitefish,Alex P.,Oregon,2/17/19,3,We loved the resort but were disappointed by the terrain. There is very little tree powder skiing due to trees growing close together. We found best powder on edges of blue runs under main chair. Most of those runs are not groomed so what we hoped would be powder on groomed was pow on moguls. Also the top is 6800 so it is like cascade snow but drier due to extreme cold. Back to colorado or utah next vacation unless they groom way more here. Lodging food staff fantastic!
Y,30,Whitefish,Carren R.,Montana,6/30/14,5,We just completed the adventure park ropes courses...It was a lot of fun. The courses are challenging especially the black diamond! I would recommend the park. We have skied here before too and it was equally great! Thumbs up.
Y,31,Whitefish,Mark M.,Texas,2/16/14,5,"Have skied all over the world and Whitefish is the best kept secret...just tough enough to get to...but when you get here you are rewarded with world class skiing, hotels (The Lodge at Whitefish Lake), inexpensive lift tickets, great restaurants, rowdy pubs, and friendly people. This place may not be chi-chi like Beaver Creek, Vail, or Aspen; but I'll take exceptional runs and low key folks any day of the week."
Y,32,Whitefish,Amy V.,Wisconsin,7/8/17,5,"The 7-line ziplining was super fun! The guides were very personable and learned everyone's names and remembered them throughout! Will and Ruth were great guides! If you love ziplining or need something to do, I highly recommend this!"
Y,33,Whitefish,Heather B.,Virginia,10/4/13,5,"My friend and I spent our last day in Montana at the Whitefish Mountain Resort in late August 2013 and had a great time. The prices were not bad for what you get. Plus, you can't beat the views from the gondola going to the top of the mountain. We tried the alpine slide while we were there and it was fun. As adults we were fine doing it just once. But, they do offer ticket packages where you can ride the slide a couple of times if you like.

We also really enjoyed taking the gondola to the top of the mountain and were very happy we bought the round-trip tickets. The hike back down is over 4 miles long and we were done hiking after exploring Glacier all week. The view, as I mentioned, is fantastic from the top. We also enjoyed exploring the nature center, talking with the friendly and knowledgeable ranger there, and looking out of the expansive windows with their binoculars. Afterward, we enjoyed a hot chocolate from the bar and sat at one of the picnic tables on their deck outside. Then we hiked a few feet down the mountain and picked huckleberries.

All in all it was a great way to end our time in Northern Montana. I would definitely go back and this time also try the zip line and the walk in the treetops. We didn't have nearly enough time to do it all. But we would definitely go back."
Y,34,Whitefish,David C.,California,12/2/16,5,"We did Aerial Adventure Park on a down day for a bachelor party a couple of summers ago, and it was awesome!  All the guys had a great time, especially the groom.  The courses are pretty challenging and it did take 30-45 minutes to go through 1 circuit, especially with 4 people.  You end up getting caught up in the fun and do stop quite a lot to enjoy the view of the course design, along with watching and encourage your friends as they manuever the course.  

Definitely recommend doing this over the luge/sledding.

Wish something like this was closer to home!"
Y,35,Whitefish,Jennifer S.,New York,9/28/18,5,"Our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 daughters,  10 and 11) had a great time spending a July day here. We bought the aerial adventure package and loved all of the ropes courses (lots of variety of skill level) , alpine slides and the lift to the top was incredible views! (Good food and beer at the top too). My kids wanted to go back the next day!"
Y,36,Whitefish,Paula J.,California,7/31/13,5,"Go Do the Zip Line the Big Mountain !!!

Man, they have got this going on.... So organized and so much fun!
Friendly, helpful, and caring staff---you feel like you just made some best friends!  They remember everyone's names, hometowns, family members, and on and on....

There are 7 awesome zip lines now, and each is worth the small hikes to get there. Water stations are also a nice addition, as well as the photographers that take great shots (for sale after the zips) of the adventure.... I sure wasn't gonna risk dropping my phone/camera flying thru the air.  Worth the trip up the mountain."
Y,37,Whitefish,Jeremy H.,Virginia,3/21/11,5,"Just returned from a trip to Whitefish Mountain, and couldn't have had a better trip.

It's off the beaten path, for sure, but if you don't mind flying into a smaller airport (Glacier National) it's hard to find another mountain out west that's as close to an airport as Whitefish.  They get a solid base, lots of annual snowfall totals, and low crowds ...

Wait a minute ... come to think of it, don't go to Whitefish. It's no good. :)

*Updated Jan 2012* - decided on another trip to Whitefish this January and still in love with this mountain.  Virtually limitless terrain, for all levels of skiers, is available, and with the low attendance you can find fresh powder lines just about anywhere.  This is a gem - if you want a true ski resort experience this isn't going to be your thing (although they do have a very nice lodge), but if you want powder runs then you have to check out The Big Mountain."
Y,38,Whitefish,Deanna S.,Arizona,2/18/14,5,"So so so amazing! Very friendly staff and so helpful. The photographers are great as well, we got some great photos of our trip. And of course the snow was absolutely amazing!!!!!!! Thanks whitefish for a great weekend! Only thing I suggest is to pack a lunch if you don't like burgers, chili, or pizza. The food was definitely not the greatest, I would suggest they get a burrito shack or something."
Y,39,Whitefish,Wizard O.,Montana,12/20/17,5,I'm impressed. Nice facilities. Efficient and helpful staff. Plenty of amenities. Great skiing.
Y,40,Whitefish,Taryn A.,Virginia,8/17/14,1,"After hiking the Danny On Trail and starving, the Base Lodge Cafe was very disappointing. The buffalo burger, bacon, onions, and bun were all burnt (black) and not enjoyable. The onion rings were good and my boyfriend said the milkshake was good. But for a burger that's $13 (not including shake and onion rings) I would expect much better."
Y,41,Whitefish,John W.,Montana,8/5/12,4,"We did the zip line and new aerial course this past weekend.  All I can say is it is great family time.  I felt safe and the staff is very courteous.  Bring a pocket full of money as it is expensive to do all you will want to.  The new aerial course is fun and both my 20 year old as well as 10 year old were challenged.  

Very much recommend."
Y,42,Whitefish,Maximillian S.,California,12/17/14,5,"Great place to ski, snowboard, and relax. They have a bunch of runs and slopes open. The staff is super nice and helpful! The lodges have really good food and a lot of beer and drinks to choose from. The hot apple cider is really good and soothing. Awesome place to go!"
Y,43,Whitefish,Kristy W.,Washington,12/29/16,5,"Highly recommend for beginners!  Nice price of $22 (kids 6 and under free) for three of the green beginner chairlifts plus magic carpet. The magic carpet is a zoo, but chair nine is perfect for a kid (or adult) with only a day or two of skiing experience. Such a great run!  Gradual and scenic.  We saw deer from the chairlift.  There is even a nice view of the valley! Also loved the lodge and its reasonably priced fare."
Y,44,Whitefish,Vicki L.,California,6/9/12,5,"Great pool, hot tub, spa, location on the lake. Very friendly service. Loving this place!"
Y,45,Whitefish,Becky J.,Minnesota,3/24/17,5,"Great skiing, incredible scenery, reasonable prices!"
Y,46,Whitefish,Jennifer S.,Arizona,9/8/13,5,"We checked out the Walk in the Treetops Friday morning and had a great experience!  Our guides were friendly, knowledgeable and made us feel comfortable on our journey.  The walk itself was really cool and afforded beautiful views of the Flathead Valley.  This is a must do when visiting the area!"
Y,47,Whitefish,Truth S.,Montana,3/2/11,4,"A great hill to spend the day at with the fam.

Pros-

Gets a ton of great snow
Nice snow park for boarders
Good front and backside
Close to town
Many Runs and limitless terrain to explore
Several nice bars to relax and enjoy some beverages
Staff is friendly and helpful
Lots of friendly Montanans and Canadians
---- Go to Costco and get 2 lift tickets for $100 ($64 at the hill)

Cons-

Not a ""Resort"" experience like advertised, at least not like other high end hills  
FOG city, any given day can become a socked in toilet bowl of clouds. I have struggled finding the bottom of the hill at the end of the day it has been so cloudy.
It's rare to get good visibility.
The rack rate of $64 is too much for this hill. However the location drives the price. Regular skiers will always get the season pass which is a good deal.

All in all, it's a great hill and you will enjoy yourself. Just check the weather 1st!"
Y,48,Whitefish,Corey L.,Massachusetts,3/3/14,5,"My girlfriend's father lives in Kalispell, so they come every winter for a week of skiing. They love it. It's out of the way so not often packed, but the mountain and skiing are top of the line. This is my first trip in the first week of March. It's been the coldest it's ever been in March, lifts closed, NOT comfortable. As it warmed slightly, it started snowing a lot. It's been pretty bad weather, but the slopes are still really fun and great. My girlfriend's family are all hardcore skiers and she told me it was a solid Yelp 5. I don't know skiing that well, but she said it's comparable to any world class slope, just a bit removed. And unlike Colorado, not nearly as sunny. Also the snow is pretty light it seems - good powder, not much ice or heavy snow"
Y,49,Whitefish,Mitch L.,Washington,3/17/12,3,"Whitefish is a pretty decent mountain for beginner to advanced skiers.  It's very family-friendly, with a good variety of runs easily accessible from the main lift.  It's also a fairly big mountain, with four skiable peaks and more than eight lifts and t-bars.

During my visit, the weather was fairly warm and wet, but there was still some pretty great powder near the summit.  Some friendly locals showed me some great runs.  One required what I'd describe as a ""medium length"" hike, but the payoff was a spectacular stash of virgin powder on some great terrain.  Thanks, guys!

The resort itself is beautiful.  I was very impressed with the size, quality, and cleanliness of the room I stayed in.  That said, the bed was hard enough that it did give me some trouble sleeping, and for how many buildings there are in the ""village,"" there's surprisingly little selection in terms of food.

My review has been very positive so far, so you might wonder why I've only given Whitefish 3/5 stars.  Well, there are a few downsides.  First, although the mountain has a lot of skiable area, the vertical drop is only 2353 feet (717 meters.)  Compared to nearby mountains like Revelstoke, that's not great, and it's very evident in the runs.

While there is lots of good terrain to be found, the best spots are difficult to get to, and because there's so little vertical, the challenging terrain will only last you a couple minutes if you know what you're doing.  After that, you're stuck on long, slow, boring cat tracks to get back to the lift.  I really enjoyed Hellroaring Basin and the East Rim Face, but the former comes out at the bottom of a rickety old chair that takes forever to get back up the mountain, and the latter can be bombed down in a matter of seconds when the snow is good, only to leave you with a ten-minute slog across a mostly-flat green run.

My other complaint is that the resort staff don't seem to be super diligent about opening lifts on time and keeping guests informed about closures.  On the first day of my visit, the opening of the main chair was delayed by half an hour because rime from the previous night had to be cleaned off the seats.  I find that a little perplexing given that the chair normally opens at 9:30, which is already a half-hour later than every other resort I've ever been to.  Additionally, they didn't do a great job of communicating about the situation to the people waiting in line.  To be fair, ice-covered chairs are a safety issue and sometimes the weather causes unexpected surprises, so I'd readily forgive the staff for being a half hour late to open the chair one day.  

What I won't  forgive, though, is that on the second day the Bigfoot T-Bar was closed for no apparent reason, with no indication of its closure on any of the signs I looked at.  I know what you're thinking: why would you want to ride a t-bar anyway?  From what I understand (and from what I've seen of the area), the Bigfoot services some pretty respectable powder runs.  I was annoyed that I rode down to it twice only to find it closed.

To finish this ""compliment sandwich"" and summarize, I did enjoy my time at Whitefish, and it is a good resort.  Families will love it here, and if you're coming from southern Montana there's probably nothing better around.  However, if you're an expert skier or snowboarder--you eat black diamonds for breakfast and only start to work up a sweat when you're on a gnarly double-black--then you may find yourself growing bored of the mountain before too long.  If you're coming in from the Calgary area, there are a several better mountains within the same distance (for example, Kicking Horse and Revelstoke).  

Everyone should give Whitefish a try, but you might not want to book a week-long ski trip here if you're looking for seriously challenging terrain."
Y,50,Whitefish,Anne F.,Illinois,7/21/13,3,My family of 5 just stayed at the Sherpa in Whitefish for a few days with a goal of visiting Glacier.  The accomodations were very nice and there was plenty of room for us all. I don't know that it was worth the price but it was very nice.  (We loved being close to the pool.)  We loved going down the alpine slide and the Zipline the staff was very helpful. Everything on this mountain was pricey (especially for a slow summer day- and I bring tip cash with you).  Abbey and Jenny were awesome zipline guides!
Y,51,Whitefish,Lorand M.,Indiana,12/26/11,5," love this place.....HUGE...lots of great runs....relatively inexpensive overall...great locals....unbelievably nice people on the Mountain !

THE only negative...it can be foggy !  

This aint Aspen...there are no massage therapists doing lift line massages...of course..there really are no lift lines !

The town...and other close by towns are very nice with reasonably priced booze...food...entertainment.

This and the variety of resorts around SLT are THEEE best places to ski in the USA !"
Y,52,Whitefish,Ashley S.,California,12/30/14,5,"I highly recommend the Ski Classes and the ski instructor Lori (from Ohio.) I haven't skied since I was a little kid- a super beginner. She was super experienced, super patient, super informative, super cheer leader even when I felt like I wasn't performing well. I took 3 classes with her back to back. Without her wisdom, guidance, advice, and most importantly, her enthusiasm, I would have quit after the first 20 minutes. I cannot recommend her enough!"
Y,53,Whitefish,Michelle H.,Montana,7/9/12,5,I did the zip line and what a blast!! Our guides were wonderful and made sure our group was safe. This is something that everyone should try once!!
Y,54,Whitefish,Amanda J.,North Dakota,1/28/14,5,"Great skiing, even better views! Our kids have been begging to ride the train and we finally gave in and traveled to Whitefish from ND on the Amtrak. The ride there was full of excitement and playing cards. It was simple to get to the Resort from the train station via a taxi.  The reservation staff found the perfect property to stay within our budget and had lift tickets waiting for us at the front desk. The property was so close to the slopes we could have skied in the backdoor. Beware with being so close also means the groomers are that close, but when you are tired from skiing such a skiing such long runs, for us flat-landers it is a big hill, it doesn't really matter. We had some fog and some sun. We wish they would keep the restaurants in the Village open longer as it was difficult to get a good supper. The ride home on the train was not as fun as the ride there. We will definitely drive next time."
Y,55,Whitefish,Rick C.,Washington,5/15/11,4,"Whitefish, Montana: We ski / snowboarded right from our condo down a ""trail"" for about (3/4) of a mile to the main lifts.  Purchased our lift tickets and went up the mountain.  When it was lunch time, we ski / snowboarded down one of the runs behind our Condo, walked about 100 feet and entered the unit ...... that was really convenient!  Day One: beautiful day, could see Glacier National Park from the summit.  Day Two: foggy ... very foggy ... not fun!  The mountain is really spread out, tons of runs, very fast lifts, many QUADS... we will be back"
Y,56,Whitefish,Kim R.,California,5/1/12,4,"Pretty good hill. As another reviewer said though, it can get VERY foggy here, and it definitely dampens the skiing experience. However, sometimes on the summit you can rise above the bank of fog, and then the view is breathtaking. Definitely recommend going all the way to the top first, don't mess around with the other lifts unless you have inexperienced skiiers with you. The lodges are awesome, good food and fireplaces! Definitely a plus when my feet are frozen! They have ski lessons, and smaller slopes for kids as well. Pretty good place to ski!"
Y,57,Whitefish,Johnny C.,Montana,2/15/13,1,"Very, very unhappy right now.  As a local, living in Kalispell, I've been taking my skibike to this resort for 10 years, and last sunday, after getting on the lift and taking a run, I was pulled aside just as I was getting ready to get on the lift, a 2nd time,  told they'd had a change in policy, and I was no longer allowed to use a skibike unless I also had short skis on my feet.  I wear Sorel type boots when I ride and always have so of course I can't hook into bindings and what's the point of the bike if you have skis on your feet too, you might as well just ski.  So, they refunded my money and sent me home.  1 big problem is, after all these years of allowing me full use of all lifts, say I'd invited a skibiker from outta state, they came with me, took a run, and were told ""uh, change in policy"".  Uh, wouldn't the outta stater be discouraged after, being told honestly ""Whitefish Mtn Resort has allowed me on the lift for 10 years"", spending money to come here and ...you get the idea.  Yes skibikes have not achieved the mainstream acceptance snowboards have, but remember back in the late 80""s when very few resorts allowed snowboards on the lift?  Over the years I have encountered liftees who were not familiar with skibikes, or me, and was sent home one evening after skiing for more than 2 hours.  I made a stink about it and the next day administration assigned 2 patrol to watch me get on and off the lift and ski 3 runs with me to see if I was a hazard.  Their conclusion was, no, my feet and boots never touch the ground when getting off the lift and I could ski with general traffic, keep up, and not create a hazard.  They apologized for the nite before, told me I was good to go and that was 7 years ago, no concerns or funny looks since then.  So imagine my disdain when, this season, after having already been up there with the skibike on New Years Eve, having the disappointment, and embarrassment, of being pulled aside just as I was about to get on the lift, being taken into the shack there, put on the phone with management and told I was done for the day.  Funny thing is, for YEARS, before the resort changed hands 5/6 years ago, they used to RENT skibikes.  Yes they were awful, clunky things and you were supposed to have skis on your feet also, but...My how things change.  So.  Being that Blacktail Mountain locally has allowed me to spend my money there with no hassle for 10 years, I believe I will have to grace their slopes with my unique sport.  bummer.  I have included a pic here of me taken at Whitefish Mtn Resort on my skibike.  This resort needs to appreciate the locals more.

Y,58,Whitefish,Phil N.,Washington,2/15/09,4,"Whitefish is a hidden gem and usually boasts some of the fluffiest, dry snow with over 120 inch base.  But this year, although there is a little over 80 total inches, it still is good boarding.  

The town itself is quaint and has good bars and restaurants.  Great winter getaway trip."
