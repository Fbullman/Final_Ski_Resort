Y,1,Showdown,Brian M.,,8/25/14,5,"Showdown is the most basic skiing experience.  It's simply a great hill, with great snow, a nearly private hill/experience on weekdays and Very small crowds on weekends.  While decidedly more level 1 & 2 oriented (green and blue), there's still something on the hill for everyone.  There's no attitude, it's not a fashion or money contest, it's just great skiing and some of the best prices available in the US.

I've been skiing Showdown since 1993 and it's a must-ski every winter for my family."
Y,2,Showdown,Kendra H.,,1/7/16,5,"Great hill with all natural snow. Quite a variety of runs from basic greens to black diamonds. Very cozy, old fashioned ski hill feel. Best on weekdays!"
Y,3,Showdown,Donovan D.,,1/6/17,5,"Today was my first time back at Showdown in a couple of years, and my experience today absolutely warrants a positive review. This morning we got out of the car w/ the thermometer reading -6 F and hefty wind gusts, and we were preparing for a ""grin and bear it"" ski day. Quite the contrary: the staff (everyone from ticket sales to lesson instructors) were all beyond friendly--lots of smiles and warm greetings. The temps kept the crowds away; there were no lift lines! And the liftees were awesome, very friendly, waving as we went by, remembering who we are--if only every ski hill operated this day. Showdown is family-owned, and they go out of there way to make you feel right at home. Several times the staff were so friendly asking me how my day was, I thought that I must have forgotten meeting them before. But nope! that's just how nice they are here. ABSURDLY reasonable prices, especially compared to the bigger (less friendly) in state hills and (even less friendly) out-of-state resorts. All natural snow, no blowers. I definitely recommend stopping by for a great day on the mountain."
Y,4,Showdown,Jasmine A.,,12/14/12,5,Visited this ski area today! I must say myself along with my family had a great time! My mom and sister never skied before and after about an hour they were going down the mountain comfortably! I used to ski/snowboard when I lived in Japan and thought I couldn't get back into the hang of it. The instructors Ben and Bonnie helped my family tremendously. Super patient! And very very nice! If you want to have a good time and maybe don't want to drive hours and hours away for skiing. Showdown is your place! The area is about an hour from Malstrom Air Force Base! (the roads are clear getting there and back)
Y,5,Showdown,Scott I.,,2/28/12,5,Outstanding skiing and great people! The food is pretty good too!
