Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jan,positive,5,I love Big Mountain for ski-ing or snowboarding. It is one of the most economical mountains to ski/ride and everyone on the mountain is very friendly. Ski in / ski out is the way to go - it also gives you an excuse to go into town for a meal!
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,16-Dec,positive,5,"We have come to Whitefish Mountain Resort to ski 6 times now from FL. The snow is the best powder, and the mountain is large and diverse enough to keep our whole family entertained year after year.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,16-Dec,positive,4,"We skied two days, I am a retired disabled vet and enjoyed the great discount the first day, they second day they would not honor it for some paper work problem. The trip was so great I hated to have it end in such a terrible way."

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Mar,positive,4,We were here the third week of March 2017 after not skiing in Whitefish since the 1980s. WOW ... what a treat.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Mar,positive,4,Big Mountain aka Whitefish mountain was a great destination. We picked a week when there was a summit dining event and experienced new snow every day.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Apr,negative,3,"The breadth of skiing opportunities is simply amazing. We were here the last week of the season and there was still a 10 foot base.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Mar,negative,3,Our family loves Whitefish Mountain Resort (formerly Big Mountain). The staff at the ski resort is friendly and they strive to make each visit special. We typically start our day at the Base Lodge where the parking is best.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jan,negative,3,"Trying to get a break from the crowds and hustle and bustle of your everyday life?

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jun,negative,2,"I was not as impressed with this resort as I expected to be. We were away from the lake, but did have a view of a walking path.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Mar,positive,4,"Many years ago I came to Whitefish to buy property. Skiing was part of the benefit of relocating here. I had skied in many places around the world. Through this experience I had developed my taste for ski mountains, apre ski ambiance, and accessibility. Whitefish Mountain; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-May,negative,2,My hubby and I drove up to this lodge hoping for spectacular views of Whitefish lake. What a disappointment. Not much of a ski village really. Maybe we're spoiled by Colorado's ski resorts. üôÉ
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jan,positive,4,"The skiing is top notch, the views are amazing, and the trails and runs are all well marked and kept, plus the lift lines are basically non existent unless your on the bunny hill.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jan,positive,4,I love this mountain. It has great intermediate terrain. There are spectacular views when the weather is clear. And there are those ghost trees which are magical. Parking is easy and the VIP parking is only $5 (compare $30 at Snowmass). Lift tickets are very reasonable.; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Feb,positive,4,"My husband and I have skied all around the country and this is by far our favorite place. The views are amazing, and the staff is beyond helpful. Added bonus is the Snow Bus, no need to rent a car."

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Feb,positive,5,"If you want good powder and lots of trails to shred this is the place to go! I couldn't get over all the freshly groomed trails and thick powder spots in between the trees, love this place."
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Feb,positive,5,"Whitefish Mountain Resort is beautiful. Grab the Snow Bus (free) in Whitefish and enjoy the ride up.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Feb,positive,5,"I've been fortunate to visit WMR during both winter and summer visits the past 10 years and it's one of my favorite places. Winter skiing, summer offers outdoor activities including zip lines. Employees have always been very friendly."

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jan,positive,4,"This is a very nice ski resort, not overly large, very manageable and with lots of interesting trails for intermediate skiers.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jan,positive,5,Rode the lift to Whitefish Summit in January. The views were beyond awesome and jaw dropping.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Mar,positive,4,"Whitefish is known for its good snow, but I had not known there was so much diversity in its terrain. Hell-roaring Basin is just that, Good Medicine is better than good, and I am now sure there is much more to explore when more chairs and the Big Foot T-bar are running. Quite; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Feb,positive,4,We just got back from Whitefish and had a great week there. The ski area had a ton of snow and had something for everyone. We stayed at Morning Eagle which is a great ski in ski out condo. It could not have been closer. You can literally nearly ski into the ski locker area.; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jan,positive,4,"Our family went skiing at Whitefish Mountain Resort during the second week of January. Although we brought our own boots we had to rent skis and a snowboard.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jan,positive,4,My third winter visit over 20yrs and same conditions- soft snow turns to mashed potatoes when the inversions and fog and warmer temps invade!

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,Drove up to the mountain to sit in the sun and have a bite to eat. We did not expect to have such a great selection of food at this venue. The sandwiches we had were top notch and absolutely delicious. The coffee bar was wonderful. There are all kinds of activities going on; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jun,negative,3,Great place. Very scenic. Snow not a requirement. Great ride up gondola or chair lift. Other things to do for adventurous--mountain bike and hiking.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jun,positive,4,"My husband and I traveled to Montana as part of a 3-generation party.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Aug,negative,3,Our family of 4 zip lined for the first time on Whitefish Mountain Resort. We bought the 7 zip line package and all had a blast!

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,The biggest challege is getting up the mountain. It is very steep in places. I was thinking it must be very interesting navigating this road with snow on it. It is a very large ski facility. Our opening banquet was in the large dining area. The food was good but nothing; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,Stayed here for 2 nights for a wedding. Check-in was very late but they did refund a cleaning deposit because of that. It was an average two-bedroom hotel-type room.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,"The gondola/chairlift ride up Big Mountain in summer is definitely worth the price. We didn't have time to take advantage of all the other activities at the resort, but spending some time at the top of the mountain was an exhilarating experience in itself.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,positive,4,"I'll be the first one to admit the hike to the top was MUCH more challenging than I had anticipated, but the views along the way make it worth the effort.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,positive,4,"This is a great spot for an afternoon.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,positive,5,"we enjoyed taking the scenic tram to the top for a nice drink, while the kids spend hours on the Adventure Park. They loved it.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,positive,4,"So many good things about the resort but if you plan to eat there, think twice. Disappointing fare with below average taste, presentation and customer service"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,16-Dec,positive,5,"Only a 15 min drive from the town up to the parking lots.It didn't stop snowing the whole time we were there, it was amazing conditions. The top gets white outs a lot, but I don't mind it. There tons of fun runs, but some of the blue runs should be green. A few spots are more; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,positive,4,"We had fun riding the chair lift to the top. Beautiful day, great views and I was almost inspired to ride a mountain bike back down the slopes. Almost. Bar and gift shop at summit was disappointing. Could have used a hot chocolate. Horse flies liked me too. I would return to ski; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Feb,positive,4,"Do you need to *really* get away from it all? Are the ski resorts just a couple hours from the big city, fighting the traffic jams just not doing it for you anymore? Do you need a big mountain far away (but not as far as Everest) with views in all directions, including views; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,positive,5,"We went up to the Whitefish Mountain Resort for a few hours on our Montana trip. Just had to spend some time, acting like a couple kids. OK. Kind of old kids.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,positive,4,"This was my first time on a zip line course and it was memorable and I would recommend it to anyone that is in/near/around Whitefish, MT.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,positive,4,Quite a line up for the ski lift but moving immediately if you chose the gondola. Lots of children and adults riding up with their bikes to free-wheel back down - the bike trail makes an ugly scar on the mountainside. An amazing scenic ride to the top of Big Mountain on a summer; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Feb,positive,4,"Whitefish Mountain (also known as Big Mountain to locals) is great for skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, ski-hiking and learning how.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Aug,positive,5,"The gondola ride is well worth the eleven bucks they charge for it. Terrific views from the top, especially of Whitefish Lake and the tall peaks in GNP.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,positive,4,"Becca and Ruth were awesome guides. All personnel were friendly, and safety was the top concern.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,I road the chairlift up the mountain while my husband and teens hiked up. Hike was difficult due to a part of the trail being closed and having a steep detour around.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,"I was terrified to ride the gondola as I have a massive fear of heights, but I had to get to the Summit House for a rehearsal dinner so I got in line.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,We took the lift to the top of the mountain and were rewarded with tremendous views of the area.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Aug,positive,4,"Awesome runs for downhill. Great way to spend a day on the mountain. Hardly any lineups for chairlift. Lodging reasonable rates, but they need A/C. Suite was very hot and had hard time cooling it down for night. But a good time had by all"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Aug,positive,5,We went for hike from village to the resort at the top. Well marked pathway to the top - very tough. Took us 1hr 45 min. Choice of walking back down or taking Gondola. We walked - approx. 1hr 20 min.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,positive,4,"We love Whitefish Mountain - just a word of caution. After a wonderful lesson last year,my son and grandson were ready for another this summer.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Sep,negative,3,Drove to the resort to check it out. Beautiful place. We could see it from our rental house and wanted to take a closer look. We did go into the lodge hoping for breakfast but they only had a continental breakfast for the quest. Season hadn't started.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Aug,positive,4,"The summer is typically pretty slow on the mountain, but here are tons of things to do. We had burgers at the summit enjoying the view of flathead valley.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Sep,positive,4,"We did a chair lift ride to the top, which was amazing the views were spectacular. If our children were older and more proficient at cycling we would have hired bikes too. The runs down the mountain looked such fun. We also went on the toboggans down the hillside."
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Aug,negative,3,"We went here in August and it was 90 the day we came. By the time we got to the top it was 68.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Feb,positive,4,"I'm an avid snowboarder who travels regularly during the winter months. I cannot believe I had not been to Whitefish before.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,We went there during the summer and took a ride up to the top of the hill. Pretty nice views and nice shop at the top of the hill. There was some kind of slide at the base to go down and it looked pretty fun but we didn‚Äôt have the time to go down.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Aug,positive,4,"Ok I will admit it - I was nervous and feeling trepidation as I put on my harness to zip line as I don't like heights.

Tripadvisor,Snowbowl,18-Jan,positive,5,"We stayed one night in a deluxe double room with private bath. This is the most affordable slopeside lodging I've seen anywhere - we paid $64, and it also came with a $6 discount on the daily lift ticket. Online booking requires 3 days notice, which we didn't have - tried calling and emailing, finally talked to a guy at the ski shop, he said just come on up before the ski area closes. We got there around 2pm and the ticket office took care of us. We were the only people staying in the lodge on a Tuesday night. It's got a nice outdoor hot tub. If you want dinner, the pub next door is open till 6:30pm, so act early. Then everybody but you goes home, and it's very peaceful until the groomers get started around 1:00am - but they head up into the hills, so didn't really bother us.; The room was basic but warm and just what we needed. And the skiing was great the next morning, with the lift just steps from our door.; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Snowbowl,17-Jun,positive,5,"I have called three times now trying to ask one simple question about the zip line. The voice mail systerm doesn't seem to work - whatever button you press takes you somewhere random. The system hangs up on you if you press the same button twice. When I finally got to the voice mail box for ""Gia"" it said, ""We hardly ever check this voice mail."" If they can bother to answer the phone or even check voice mail I can't imagine that they would provide good service or safe equipment."
Tripadvisor,Snowbowl,17-Mar,negative,3,"If proximity to Missoula is your only consideration, Snowbowl is the perfect ski area. If any semblance of pride in ownership matters, don't look too closely at the filthy, unstocked bathrooms, old food ground into the carpet, unpleasant owner or consideration of annual pass holders. Even the new locker/changing room downstairs is half finished, dirty, and unwelcoming. The slopes are kept well groomed, sort of, but go to any other ski area in Montana and you'll notice the difference. No lift lines during the week and the coffee isn't half bad."
Tripadvisor,Snowbowl,16-Feb,positive,4,"Great little ski resort, over 2000 feet of vertical terrain, getting another new lift this year. Can get icy at times and busy on the weekends. Flagstaff is a great town away from the busy city life of Phoenix."
Tripadvisor,Snowbowl,16-Jan,positive,4,We skied on a weekday and there were no lift lines. Runs were in great condition. A fun ski area for all abilities. Check out the stay free deals if you need lodging in Flagstaff. Would recommend to all!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-Feb,positive,4,"This is where I ski nearly 100% of the time. RLM doesn't have the super gnarly runs that Jackson Hole or Big Sky have but it still has a wide variety of terrain that will satisfy just about anyone and also doesn't cost an outrageous amount for a lift ticket. The food is better than average and not as expensive as other pricier ski areas. The staff is always friendly and helpful, especially the Mountain Hosts who help get your kids to ski school, help unload your vehicle and even carry bags and skis for you. This is a good place for families and the ski school does an excellent job with kids. The only real downside is that there are no lodging facilities at the mountain but the town of Red Lodge is only 6 miles away and there are several motels and good restaurants in town."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,,positive,5,"I was a first time visitor Jan. 15-18, 2012. It will not be my last. \n\nMy son and I took our ski vacation this year and decided on Red Lodge Montain Resort as our destination because Red Lodge had the most significant amount of snow year to date. Great choice on our part even though we drove 770 miles from Sioux Falls, SD. For me as long as Red Lodge has the snow I will gladly make it an annual trek. \n\nThe staff at the resort were fantastic, everyone from ticket sales to lift ops were friendly and helpful. \n\nThe ski chow was great and not overpriced. This was truly a mom and pop, old fashioned down to resort. \n\nAs an intermediate skier, the terrain was all I could ask for, the variety of runs was awsom. My son (a ski instructor), was more than content with the variety of terrain. \n\nThe snow, dry fluffy powder, wow!!\n\nI'll be back..."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-Jan,positive,4,"We went to RLM because they had the most snow of all the Montana ski hills within 1 days drive of our home in Alberta Canada. We appreciated getting discounted lift tickets at our B&amp;B and the fact that there were no crowds and 14"" of fresh powder"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,,positive,4,This is one of the most gorgeous drives in Montana. The views are amazing! A must see!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,11-Dec,positive,5,"We drove out from Minneapolis over the Christmas week 2011. \n\nThis place has a monster rise off the local terrain. We had stopped in Billings on the way out to buy discount lift tickets - adults at $42 rather than $49, (college kids get them for $32 at the hill), and could see not only the hill but the runs from the edge of Billings - 50 miles away. The town of Red Lodge is at 5500 ft, the plains below probably at 4000 ft or less, so the view from the top was huge. You could see the Crazy mountains and I'm quite sure the Bridger range to the west. Behind were the peaks and high plateau of the bear tooth range - spectaular. The ski hill peaks are at 9700, chalet base is 7700, but the palisade area drops another 400' for the advertised 2400' vert. But the impressive part is it's 2000 ft straight down. Two main runs run from top to bottom, one is black diamond (upper and lower limited), the other intermediate (lazy M) (but in the midwest it would also be black diamond). All of us went down Lazy M, but it isn't lazy. You wouldn't be able to bomb it - and the limited, which is groomed - would get you up around a hundred if you tucked and kept your feet. That run, if left ungroomed would be a 2 mile mogul run all the way down. Even the beginner lift, Miami beach, has a grade like an intermediate run and is tilted to the fall line, so isn't the best for beginners, but is a full 300 ft in elevation. Our daughters spent much time on that run. The only true beginner area is right out front the chalet in the wide ravine though which all the runs eventually funnel to the main lower lift. The Miami beach area is in it's own side ravine. The main area has a long magic carpet off the north side and a roped area for beginners and lessons. Good area for true beginners. It was packed. \n \nFive days before we arrived they got 2 feet of snow. Three days before our arrival temps got up into the 40s. We saw little powder, almost all hard packed power, and a touch of the hard stuff. Conditions were actually very good and what we like to ski, but I was surprised it settled and got knocked down so fast. This hill was completely open, base of 4' +, nothing else in the West as far as I know was even 75% open at this time, so folks normally running off to Big Sky for the day or Bridger were here. The parking lot is small for ski area size and cars were parked on the side of the access road going a full mile down the road. My wife had an old guy sit with her for a while and said normally the top lot is only half full. Yet in spite of having record crowds, and mostly older lifts, there were no real lift lines. Even on day 2 when they closed the upper lifts due to wind, my son and I took the willow lift multiple times - no lines. An exception to this was the Miami beach lift which ran at a snails pace had a long line and the high speed quad in the palisades area had a bit of a line. The main triple lift flies along, they have a sign in front telling you you'll get knocked on your can if you don't pay attention. \n \nMy son and I skied much on the front side and Latigo in the Cole Creek area. Again very steep grade for an intermediate run. His gps showed a 1000+ ft drop in about a mile. I skied true grit (double black) once - steep with mostly shallow bumps..And of course there was a family of 4 going down it - mom, dad, sister and little sister - about age 5. Not sure what their motivation was - at their rate they were going to get just one run in. Our second time down this area we took the trail that goes to the bottom of the palisades. My son said it was the best trail he's ever been on. Dangerous weaving thing, hard to keep the speed down. Other great mogul runs were Berrys, Thompsons' and Royals run. Even on the lower level of the hill off the side of the main ridge, they had runs like Bigfoot and Bear paw that longer bump runs than most in the Midwest. \n \nBest part of the hill is the terrain, from looking at google earth and the tail map, I underestimated the size and topography. It's much larger, steeper, and varied than I expected. Ridges, valleys and heavily treed. Much more interesting terrain than Solitude and Winter Park, and from what I remember of Keystone and A-basin. Similar but obviously smaller, yet more challenging than Snowmass. The Drainage area looked cool from the chair but not like the map... it's just tree skiing in a really steep gorge. I didn't try it. \n \nShort comings? Lower parking is 50 ft below upper parking. Upper parking is 20 ft below the chalet. Step out of the undersized Chalet, and you have to walk up 12 ft of hill to get to either of the lift lines. Had they not flattened out the area for the parking, they could have continued the runs down another 500 feet into the ravine. They're short of flat areas. Instead of fanning out onto flats, it all funnels in to a congested, overly steep area. I didn't mind, nor did our kids, but not an easy place for beginners. The upper chalet was very nice. Day 2 we stopped in early - almost empty. Next we stopped at noon, jam packed, but again the weather went from calm, sunny and 35 in the morning to maybe 40 mph gusts midday. \n \nThe entire area is in a national forest with limited base facilities for the size of the hill. Sort of like Lutsen on a busy day. They did put in 2 high speed quads in sometime ago - for Cole creek and Palisades, but in my opinion they should have used the Palisade quad (not always in use) and used it to serve the base area, and moved dirt around to make base area more friendly. Also there is no on site lodging so it's a ski hill - not a resort. I imagine the locals would want it to stay the way forever. Limited older lodging in town, inconvenient for beginners, no glamour. In return they get great cheap skiing. I'd go back for another look. Can't say the same for three of the other places I've been to in the last few years."

Highly recommended."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Jun,negative,3,"Took a ride up the mountain in June. It ended up being one of the highlights of our trip! We pulled over and parked (after decsending and finding a great view), No one was up there, it was so quiet and smell of pine was incredible. We sat and listened to birds chirping and nothing else, it was heaven and the view was amazing."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Mar,negative,3,"If you're going to compare this to other Rocky Mt resorts you will be very disappointed. If you compare this to mid-west hills you will be pretty happy. If you compare this to east coast hills you will be ""meh, not what I expected the rockies to offer"". So with that said and your expectations adjusted lets talk about the mountain itself. Several nice long on-piste groomers, some nice hidden tree runs that get run out fairly quickly and a couple runs for your newbies and kids but not much to offer for the true beginner. That said the mountain and terrain gets a passing grade of a C. Now for the amenities and lodge/ food etc.. I was almost shocked at the lack of a comfortable place to take a break. The lodge is tiny and dated with one dirty bathroom for the entire resort! The food is a typical cafeteria style with limited options and poor quality. There was a mexican option in a yurt that was even a worse option than the typical hot water burgers and fries drenched in canned cheese. The trip up to the hill is long and windy, the parking is below grade, the rental shop had 5 to 6 yr old skies but were fairly efficient given the amount of people. The people however were great and friendly. The town and stay and eat options are limited and most fall below standard other than a few select places. Do yourself a favor and review everything or ask someone whom has been before you blindly chose your destination for a room or food. In closing; I will return in summer but I will question driving 500 miles again to visit the ski resort unless some major improvements are announced. Oh I forgot lift! They still get you up the hill in 50 yr old double chairs and the main chair is a triple that you sit on for 15 minutes! Wow.."

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Feb,negative,1,"The mountain seems nice but unfortunately one staff member ruined our experience. My girlfriend and I have tried to snowboard a couple of times in the past but neither of us had even taken a lesson. It had also been a few years before our last attempt. We were in Red Lodge visiting friends for the weekend and we all thought it would be fun to take advantage of the snow by going up to snowboard. Since my girlfriend and I hadn't been in a few years and had never taken a lesson we decided to take advantage of the lesson and rental package the mountain offers. Our instructor, Mitch, was nice enough. During our lesson we had told him we had tried to snowboard a couple of times in the past but had never taken a lesson. After he gave us some basics he took us over to the lift. Once we were there we were berated by another staff member. I believe his name was Craig. He yelled at us because we had tried snowboarding in the past (we assume Mitch informed him when we arrived to the lift) and said we should not have purchased the package. He told us twice that we needed to quit purchasing that deal as if we had done so in the past. He said it was for first timers only and that they have more intermediate lessons for a higher price that we should have paid. It was a little embarrassing and made us feel we did something wrong. Mitch did apologize for his co-worker after we got off the lift but we were still a bit frustrated. After leaving and re-visiting the website we believe we purchased the correct package. I have copied and pasted directly from their website:\n\n""Beginner lessons are perfect for first-time skiers and snowboarders of all ages, and for those who need a little extra work on the basics (turning or stopping). Our learning area and easy-to-ride Magic Carpet provide a safe and fun place to get started.\n\nAll beginner lesson packages include:\n\n1 Miami Beach Lift ticket\n90 minutes of group instruction\nEquipment rentals""\n\nWe definitely needed help with stopping and turning and struggle with falling. Craig needs to review their own policies and not berate paying patrons. His attitude and actions soured our visit. I don't foresee returning here and spending our money when there are much friendlier options. Our friends also mentioned that the season passes have almost doubled in the last few years. Seems like other places are also cheaper. Save your money and visit and more cost effective mountain with friendlier staff."

This resort is clean, the staff are always friendly, and reasonably priced. The one thing I like is that it offers slopes for all abilities and when your kids get old enough to venture on their own or with friends, there is basically 1 main area they have to end up at when coming down from the top/middle. We can always keep an eye on them or so it seems."

We spent two days on the slopes and loved the unique mounting. Warming huts are tucked away on countless runs and the Mid-Mountain Hut was beautiful!\n\nPalisades offered incredible views and easier skiing for beginners and the Grizzly Chair was great for intermediate or advanced skiers. Only complaint was the road up to the resort, it's a little worn and the parking fills quickly. Besides that the lift lines were short, terrain was great, and staff was incredible! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a big-mountain weekend trip! Enjoy!"

For the skiing, cost, and ski town experience this is has to be top 3 in the country. This place is also an easy drive from MN. The last 3 years we have had our best sking in Red Lodge. No lines, amazing amounts of snow we have always had tons of powder, $45 lift tickets, rustic lodge that lets you bring I food, some of the best ‚Äúlocals‚Äù you will find anywhere, one of the top small towns in the country. If you really want a true experience try a local motel, the service is outstanding try the Red Lodge Inn. \nThe lift from the lodge is old and tired but it adds to the charm.

The lines are short, there's a decent number of runs, and lift tickets aren't too insanely priced. My only complaint is that there are years it doesn't get much snow. The combo of man-made snow and freezing cold MT winters = icy, hard snow. The quality powder is hit-or-miss."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-Jan,positive,4,"WOW!!! Red Lodge Mountain is great for first time skiers to very advance ones. Every year my family purchases a season ticket for every member and it is well worth the cost. There are three places to eat on the mountain. First is the Main Lodge where they cook Hamburgers, Hot Dogs, Soup, Nachos, Cheese Fries and a ton more things which are very good but it does get very expensive because a Cheese Burger costs $6.50. The second place to eat is the Bierstube which has a huge bar and is a more adult friendly environment. Lastly is the Midway Lodge which is right off of the Midway Ski Lift. If you are looking to have a good time in Red Lodge I would highly recommend that you at least visit the mountain once."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-Apr,positive,4,"We had a great time skiing over the Easter weekend! It snowed while we were there, so the conditions were great for their last weekend. They also had a variety of runs for all the ability levels in our group. It was not very busy the first day--no lines, plenty of room. Saturday &amp; Sunday were considerably busier, but still manageable. We will return next year!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-Mar,positive,4,"This year has been very exceptional for snow at Red Lodge, but I have always enjoyed the mountain. Had not gone skiing in 17 years, and my 2 teenage sons had never been, so it was time to go again. All of us had a great time, instructors for kid's and wife's lessons were great, lots of people learning that day, so they quickly brought in more instructors.\nThe mountain is really nice, has a mid mountain lodge that serves food also, so a trip to the bottom for lunch or a snack is not necessary. The biggest problem is no lift from bottom of mountain to top of mountain, have to ride 2 chairlifts, and takes some time. But, if you want to stay on the top half of the mountain, always short lift lines at upper chair lift. \n \nNew terrain has opened in the past few years, and really has expanded the mountain. Reasonable lift tickets at $49.00, and lessons, rentals, and lift tickets (beginner lift only) also for $49.00 each. Town is only 10-15 minutes away."

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,21-Mar,negative,3,"My daughter and I are advanced skiers. The rest of the family is more intermediate but they stayed behind.\n\nLifts\nMain lifts are slow and older. You have to take to chair lifts to summit. They have nicer lifts in the back but they run them slow.\n\nFacilities\nAgain, older. This is a small resort. Do not expect shopping, lots of food and drink. The parking lots are gravel and rough. You need to take steps from the lower lot. These are not necessarily bad things but you need to expect that this more of a local hill.\n\nScenery \nBeautiful views and terrain. Some really pretty rock formations and forests on the backside.\n\nSkiing\nThe stuff that matters. I have to state the snow conditions were end of year. The week after we left they had multiple powder days. While we were there the snow was getting thin and half the trails were very icy. Some of the most icy I have skied. I live and ski regularly in the midwest and we know icy. \nI would not take my intermediate family members to this hill. The groomed runs are short. There is only one good intermediate run from. The summit...Lazy M. The remainder are black and double black, mostly ungroomed. Lots of bumps. My daughter and I worked on our bump skiing all week. The runs are on the thinner side. \n\nSummary\nThis is a skiers mountain. Beautiful scenery, advanced skiing, slow and older facilities...NO CROWDS! Town is great with good food. I wish the snow conditions would have been better...but that is spring!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,21-Mar,negative,1,"We travelled from Minnesota to meet family and ski at Red Lodge Mountain. The first day the lift to get up to the top half of the mountain was broken so we could only ski on the bottom half - so we kind of only got half our money's worth (and the prices are getting steep).\n\nThe second morning, my cousin's wife ran afowl of the covid rules by going inside the lodge with her toddler to get out of the snow and warm up (you are supposed to wait in your car all day down in the parking lot) and they were kind of harsh with her about it. So at lunch when my cousin came in and heard about it, he went and told the guy ""don't treat my wife that way"" and a few heated words were exchanged and they could have just left it at that - but they didn't. Soon after, as they were eating, another guy came up and told my cousin and his family and his brother, who wasn't even involved but happened to be sitting with them, to get out - they couldn't ski anymore. They couldn't even finish their overpriced food. It all felt very vindictive.\n\nTo be fair, most of the employees were nice enough and the skiing was pretty good. But it just rubbed me the wrong way that they would pick a fight with a young mother trying to keep her toddler warm and then kick their family out along with a brother that wasn't even involved. Their zeal for covid seems to be overriding any kind of reason or compassion."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,21-Mar,negative,1,"After purchasing a two day pass, and then realizing after only 10 mins that my group only did day passes I tried to get a refund on just 1 and it was turned down. Can‚Äôt go again as I‚Äôm out of state."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,21-Jan,negative,3,"My teenage son and my brother and I did a holiday break ski trip through Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota, mostly hitting the little independent places. We stayed in Jackson but skied Snow King and Grand Targhee instead of Jackson Hole. We skied the Tetons, the Bighorns, the Black Hills and Red Lodge. Of all of that, our two days in Red Lodge was my favorite.\n\nI was concerned that the lack of snow was going to severely limit what was available. Nope. True, two of the lifts were closed, but from what I understand that's not unusual... I've read that some seasons they don't open Palisades at all. But no matter. And I will confess that my skis were badly abused, but the terrain was so fun that I just needed to get into the less well covered portions of it.\n\nMy favorite terrain was accessed from the top of Grizzly lift. There were plenty of black diamond mogul runs from there, a popular cruiser called Lazy M, and a nice blue mogul run (Barriers). A really enjoyable non-stop summit-to-base was to dodge moguls and rocks down Barriers, then duck through the trees in Little Forest.\n\nIf you're looking for glamour, forget it. For me, I think that's what I liked about it."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,21-Jan,negative,2,"It's no surprise that Red Lodge Mountain has been rapidly increasing their rates in the last 3+ years, but now they have a new money grab. Until a few weeks ago they had normal group lessons for the 4-6yr olds, but they just recently changed it to ""Learn to ski with your child"". This is the only way for your 4 to 6-year-old to receive a lesson. Regardless of whether you are a seasoned skier yourself, you now have to pay $59/$65 extra to accompany your child. Their website states ""This lesson program pairs you and your child with an instructor who will teach you how to safely and effectively ski with your little one, while also providing your child with new skills."" Impossible to teach me how to ""safely and effectively ski with your little one"" when he didn't speak to me or the other dad at all. If the sole reason for having the parent there is for COVID then why is the instructor picking my child up 1/3 of the time. I understand making it mandatory for the parent to be there to assist but to charge the adult $59/$65 just to be there and to not receive any instruction on how to ""safely and effectively ski with your little one"" is completely ridiculous. The whole lesson was ridiculous. It was the instructor and just two children. The instructor didn't seem to want to be there. He barely spoke to the kids and gave them very little instruction. I don't think he even asked them their names or called them by name not even once. This is our 3rd time using the RLM ski school and our older child received excellent instruction on her previous classes in that same age range group lesson in previous years. It's a shame our 5-year-old had such a bad intro to skiing with this instructor. Hoping for a better experience next time."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Dec,negative,3,Thank you Red Lodge Mountain! I feel so lucky that I am able to stay safe while skiing. Very appreciative of everyone at RLM who has worked so hard to keep everyone safe this winter and be able to open. I feel safe skiing here knowing that the mountain is following all COVID-19 protocols. Would recommend this place to anyone.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Dec,positive,4,"Very family friendly. Relaxing, great runs, The lazy M is a great run for everyone and fits everyone's ability."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Dec,negative,1,Unsafe ski resort - stay away. I watched an entire chair fall of the lift today as two people were boarding. Luckily no one was hurt. The lift should have been closed for a safety inspection (duh!) after something like this happened. They re-attached the chair and started running it again right away. What would have happened if it came off when the people were 30 feet up in the air? It was really creepy to watch.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Sep,negative,3,"We loved exploring the lovely, charming and friendly town of Red Lodge. As a bonus we learned that the Highway had reopened after an early season snow storm, so we drove it to the scenic Vista. Spectacular views from every switch back, view point and turn in the rid. Beautiful mountain, and pretty streams in the meadow, too."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,3,"We skied at Red Lodge last week. Even though the warmer temps made for less than ideal skiing conditions, we have a good time. Everyone from the lift operators to restaurant workers to the ticket sellers were great. We will definitely be back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,3,We really enjoyed the ease and convenience of our trip. Ski rental and purchase of lift tickets was fast and easy. No long waits at the lifts. Will definitely be visiting again. Only downside was number of runs open due to lack of natural snow as well as use of runs for competitive events that made them off limits to us and no fun to ski the day after. Very economical.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,positive,4,Had a great father/daughter trip...variety of runs....both of us had a great time..enjoyed no crowds!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,positive,4,"I love Red Lodge Mountain, and I get out there a few times each year. Great people, great town, fun mountain, and way cheaper than most other ski areas in the west. Snow has been a little scarce this season, but they've been doing a great job with what they have."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,positive,5,Never met a more helpful and friendly group of people anywhere. Snow hasn't been great this season but all the staff had a great attitude. Beirstube is great for lunch or after the lifts close for a little unwinding after a day of snowboarding.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,3,"The staff at red logde are absolutely wonderful.They are friendly and helpful. It has a small town feel. Snow could have been better, but can't control mother nature."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,1,"The resort did not have much snow this year, but we were lucky enough to get one to 2 inches while there. Instead of letting everyone ski on it , however, they let it be groomed into a giant ice block. This reflects some very poor management I feel on the mountain, where skiing is not taken very seriously. I will probably only return when there is an abundance of snow."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,3,"Red Lodge is quaint, the people are friendly, and the runs are well worth the drive. We snowboarder on Sunday and Monday and never waited for the lift."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,2,"Staff at Red Lodge Mountain are fantastic, as was the mountain itself. Was frustrating however that although totally understandable for patron safety the lifts were closed due to high winds until noon that once opened a little after 12:00 we still had to pay for the entire day even though we lost more than 3 hours of skiing time."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,positive,4,"Great day on the mountain, fresh snow, great employees. Buy your ticket online for great savings. Easy drive to the mountain, road well maintained."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Dec,negative,2,"Joined extended family for a ski/snowboard vacation at Red Lodge and left disappointed in the experience at Red Lodge Mountain. While the town of Red Lodge is very quaint and the people are extraordinarily nice, the mountain and runs are very lacking. First, for beginners like my youngest child, there were no good options. The one run that really caters to beginners (Miami Beach) was hampered by a chairlift that was shut down for a significant portion on two separate days and then was coaxed to work by skipping every other chair for at least three more days. Second, for intermediate skiers there are a few okay runs, but none of them were fantastic and many were very icy and seemed to be over-groomed. And this has been a fairly decent season weather-wise. There are a decent number of expert runs, but none of them were all that long. Again, the weather has been pretty good here this season so far, but there were very few runs that had good powder. They are hopeful to open a few more runs in the upcoming days, but that will do us no good. Our family took a day trip and went to Bridger Bowl just north of Bozeman (a 2-1/2 drive from Red Lodge) and were blown away by how much better that mountain was ... and the cost was the same. If you want to go on a nice ski vacation in Montana, there are many better options than Red Lodge."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Dec,positive,4,"Not enough GREEN runs, and the BLUE runs were more difficult that expected. Be sure to ski (or board) ""Lazy-M"" - it became my favorite Lift attendants and staff at the lodge were helpful, freely gave assistance and were friendly!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Dec,positive,5,"This is a great mountain to ski on, the staff are always friendly and the runs are fun. I know this is more of a spring skiing place, when the snow hits there isn't a run you don't want to go on"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Dec,positive,5,No lift lines. All types of terrain. Incredible views. Reasonable prices. The snow was plentiful and the people are friendly. What more could you want?
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,positive,5,"This may sound bad, but we don't ski here as much as we used to. Typically, we stop now on the way out to Bozeman or Big Sky, or on the way home. There are not a lot of decent hotel choices that accommodate 5, and there are many places we used to stay that I wont go back to anymore. That does have an impact on us skiing here. The mountain itself struggles with snow - I would say only 4 times out of 20+ years have we skied the expansion territory - and it is some fun area to ski. That's not anyone's fault - just the way it is. When they get dumped on, there is nothing like it - it is a blast."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,positive,4,We have skied at Red Lodge twice and had a great experience on both trips. Friendly staff and short lines...great ski resort!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jul,positive,5,"After our tremendous ride on the Beartooth Highway, we visited the town of Red Lodge. Many good restaurants, nice town to walk, great family time. Just a fun afternoon with the family."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Nov,negative,3,My husband and I went up to the Lodge to watch the skiers and snow boarders come down the mountain. Had a hot chocolate and just relaxed.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,positive,5,We were here in Jan 2016 and skied 4 days here. Good place with no lines. We enjoyed it and will be back.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Mar,negative,3,"Since ND had no snow, we went to Red Lodge. We got our lift tickets in advance &amp; skied a total of 7 the 3 weekends we were out there. The lift attendants were very professional &amp; courteous! Hard to find in this day &amp; age. The staff in the rental shop(skied w/one of them) &amp; the staff at the store were also great!. The ski instructors were always busy. I had thought about doing the learn &amp; earn package, that way they could get off the bunny hill &amp; do some skiing w/another ski instructor. But we didn't have time. The staff at the Midway Chalet were great &amp; the Staff at the Bierstube were always courteous. The ""Stube"" was always packed when we were there, &amp; the staff was always apologizing for our food taking so long. I have been in their shoes &amp; understand. We always thanked them &amp; told them we are ok &amp; not in a hurry. It put a couple of the waitresses at ease! kudos to Madeline for busting her buns the 3 weekends we were there."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,13-Mar,positive,4,"My wife and I went back to Red Lodge to ski after over 10 years. We had the best time. Took in part of the Winter Carnival on the mountain, and enjoyed skiing with no lift lines and open runs. Weather was great and the snow good for the most part."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,13-Feb,positive,4,"Food was cheap and the lift lines were next to nothing. Good local mountain - get there early so you don't have to walk a mile to the mountain. They offer a shuttle in the morning, but you'll have to walk back to your car in the afternoon - the earlier you get there, the closer you park."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,13-Feb,positive,5,"We love skiing Red Lodge Mountain! \n\nThe members of the staff are all very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe lodge atmosphere is relaxed and casual. \n\n RLM is very family-oriented with the magic carpet and Miami Beach lift for beginners. \n\nHowever, there are green, blue, &amp; black diamond trails for all levels of skiers.\n\nThe town of Red Lodge is one of the friendliest anywhere with beautiful, historic district houses &amp; buildings. \n\nA best-kept secret in the Rockies!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,13-Feb,positive,4,A nice local ski area without all the resort hype. Outstanding terrain on a powder day. Worth the stop on the way to Big Sky.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,,positive,5,We had family fun day in the snow....the price was great and the staff was wonderful...being out of shape was a issue ...but we still had a blast...we spent 5 hour had lunch and went home for naps....
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-Nov,positive,5,sweet place . lots to see and do. great food. also try off road MeetsieTeetsie trail nearby. Ski area is also great\n
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-Feb,positive,4,"We ski there two or three times a year. Lots of terrain and the lines are very short. The longest I ever wait is maybe two minutes. The double black diamonds are exactly that...don't go there unless you are an EXPERT! Terrain park is really fun. Most scenic section is Palisades chairlift, only open when it is busy on the weekends and there is a lot of snow. The Midway Lodge is half way up the mountain and has good eats for a fair price."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-Oct,negative,3,"Grew up on this mountain and love it just because it's the local place to hang out - you're constantly running into people you know. :) When it gets good snow, it's completely epic. Most of the year, it seems you're dodging a few ice patches and/or rocky spots, but that's just the essence of Red Lodge. :) Plus, if you know where to go, you'll get the good white stuff!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,11-Dec,positive,5,"excellent rates, helpful staff. We visited over xmas break and it was my daughter's first time skiing. We signed her up for lessons, rented skis and bought lift tickets for the ""easy"" lift only and the cost was only around $100 for the both of us. She spent the morning learning to ski and we had a wonderful afternoon skiing together. Lovely facility and a great price"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-Jul,negative,3,Really cute town with shops and restaurants. Easy to get around in by foot or car. Easy access to the mountains - Yellowstone and skiing.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,3,So much fun when there is not a lot of people. Had zero lines on Christmas Eve it was a lot of fun!!!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,positive,5,The staff is wonderful on the mountain. Not all runs covered in snow due to high winds the days before but the runs that were open were great.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,positive,4,"Ronnie working at the Miami beach lift is amazing with the new kids. So gentle and encouraging. \nThe other gentleman scanning tickets took time to explain to me why my sons board bindings weren't correct, what I needed to buy and how it affected his ankles and ride. Thanks for the exceptional staffing!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,positive,5,Red Lodge is always fun! The instructors and lift operators are always so nice! Love visiting this place!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,positive,4,"The whole crew was excellent from the get go, from picking up our lift tickets purchased online, to the very streamlined equipment rental process and getting on the very first lift all the way to the last ride up and then the rental returns! Every employee we spoke to, or even passed by, was extremely freindly and very helpful. Even during the rush in the morning they did not get flustered or irritated, in fact it was quite the opposite, just took us all in stride and got us out the door! When we returned our gear and my fat belly prevented me from getting my boots off in a proffecient manner, one of the employees came over and gave me a hand with a smile. We were asked so many times ""How is the snow, how are you doing, are you enjoying the day?"" Every time we got on a lift we were told ""have a great run"" or "" enjoy it up there"". I am extremely impressed with the whole operation and highly recommend a day on the mountain at Red Lodge, the people make it great!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,3,Everyone was very helpful and welcoming. Great mountain with staff that was always so nice and caring.

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,positive,4,Snow was great! Sucks that there was no running water and Indoor bathrooms. We didn't let that put a damper on our day though! Food was awesome too! We had a fantastic day!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,2,"Half or less open ,bare spots ,rocks ,ice, everything (walking wise) seems to be up hill, anything from parking area to lifts. Seems more like an east resort. Maybe wrong time w/low snow."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,positive,5,"we have been skiing there for a long time I try to go about 4 times a year,I plan on retiring there people are so friendly and the senrey is to die for."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Mar,positive,4,"I was happy with my first experience of Red Lodge Mountain. Being a powder snob, I have not been to this resort before, as it usually gets less snow cover than other ski areas that I frequent in Montana. However, I was pleased this season with my spring snowboarding day here. Not only was it a blue sky fabulous day (although any day on the mountain is a good day :-P ), but the runs were long and face NE, so the snow stayed good until the bottom bit of the mountain, even though the sun was beating down.\n\nDid I say it had LOOONG runs? And the employees were great and the atmosphere was that of a little local ski area instead of a destination spot like Red Lodge. How cool is that?!!\n\nThanks for the end of my season Red Lodge Mountain. It was a stellar day, and I got to be with my sweetheart on top of it. Best snowboard day EVER! LOL"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Feb,positive,5,"The price was very good, the people very helpful and the skiing was perfect. My partner took a lesson, and that didn't work out too well, but figure that is on us, we should have signed up for a higher level. When they say beginner, they mean you have never put skis on before"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Mar,positive,4,"The snow was great, there were no crowds (except at the bar at the end of day), abundant varied terrain offered a challenge and the views from the top were spectacular. The only downside was that the base facilities are very crowded."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Feb,positive,4,"We liked the terrain, and grooming. Nice lifts. It would be nice to have an inexpensive shuttle from town."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Feb,positive,5,"Very family friendly, with a family friendly budget. Wonderful staff, really took time with the kids to refresh their skills and they were able to pick right up where they left off last year!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Feb,negative,3,"The line cooks don't understand how to cook more than a single order at a time. Forty minutes after we ordered our waitress assured us it would be ready in 'just a minute'. Ten minutes later, she assured us again. Five minutes later she brought us the hamburger, and then informed us the sausages had just been put on the grill. In total - one hour and five minutes to get a hamburger, two sausages and a cup of soup. Yes, the place was full and a few tables outside were occupied. Everyone seemed to be going through the same hostage scenario. I've worked as a line cook, a waiter, and bartender, so I know the capabilities and expectations of a kitchen, and this kitchen is totally incompetent. At the very, very least they should inform anyone wishing to order food how long they should expect to wait."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Jan,positive,4,"Skied there in late January 2014. Snow conditions were great the mountain has a good variety of well groomed cruising runs and many more difficult, powder opportunities, lots of terrain to ski. Lifts on the newer areas of the hill are high speed quads, no lift lines at all while I was there. Hill staff are all very friendly. Nice place to get away from it all and do some relaxing and serious skiing."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,13-Dec,positive,4,"This is the ""old"" Colorado. Great slopes, great snow, low prices, not crowded, nice people and NOT over-commercialized! We loved this place!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,13-Dec,positive,5,"What an amazing place. The runs are really long. . . and really steep. We are used to skiing in Minnesota and this is a whole new level. It was an amazing experience. The blue hills are the equivalent to the black diamonds in Minnesota, though. The chalet is nice. Parking is great if you arrive when the rental/ticket office opens. Buy advanced tickets online and save a lot of money. If you rent for multiple days, you will need to decide if you want to keep the equipment or leave it overnight in a locker there. Overall, it was an amazing experience."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,13-Feb,negative,3,Having enough snow can be an issue at any resort. RLM has more snow making equipment than any resort I've ever seen. The terrain is really varied so there's something for everybody. The prices are very reasonable the drinks are good the food is great and there is a party in town every night.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Jan,positive,5,I Loved this little place. it is a very small and cozy. Everyone is super nice. something for everyone.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,,negative,3,Fair prices along with a good time if theres snow. I've been a few times and when theres snow this place is a blast! If not it seems the snow they make themselves was super icy and the skiing/boarding was no fun.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Dec,negative,3,"While there is a nice beginners area near the base, Red Lodge Mountain has plenty of room for advanced skiers with some potentially deep powder and trees on the advanced Cole Creek side. Lift lines are seldom and the mountain is large enough, it doesn't seem crowded. Even before Cole Creek was open, we could still find glade skiing on the rest of the mountain after a nice Christmas storm."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Dec,negative,1,The snow was packed ice and the staff was rude. Even on main runs there were sticks and rocks sticking up everywhere. All in all I was very disappointed with my experience. I won't be back.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,,negative,3,"Red Lodge Mtn is great. Small ski resort w little lift lines, great staff and the food is always great. Try the soups and sandwiches. We will be back."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Nov,negative,2,"We skied Red Lodge Mountain on Thanksgiving weekend. There were hardly any lines but they had issues with lifts on a couple of different occasions. They have one high speed quad which was not open at the time of our visit. Group ski lessons were 1:1 instructor to student but no GPS device to see how much they've skied as they have at Winter Park, Colorado. The powder was deep. We sat on a broken lift for thirteen minutes in seriously cold weather. We were slightly perplexed at the lack of barricade on the dirt road leading to the mountain. There is no base lodge hotel, buildings are dated but there is a mid mountain dining spot and several buildings at the base that house rental shop, retail, and restaurants. At the mid-mountain lodge there was a significant collection of dead moths on the handrails leading to the bathroom however none ended up in our food. A beer here costs $4.75 and that's microbrew draft. Due to the fact that half the mountain was closed lift tickets were selling at the half day rate. Book two days for about $60 advance online and there are also good deals to be had at liftopia. Still, I find myself yearning for my favorite Colorado mountain with serious bumps, high speed lifts, and multiple dining options on the mountain."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Apr,negative,3,"Second consecutive year of skiing at Red Lodge and the hill continues to deliver. Diverse terrain - including some real steeps and challenging side-country skiing - along with long blues and greens; small numbers; friendly and helpful staff and locals; and real value. \n\nOh, and the snow is just the icing on the cake - simply epic at times. \n\nLiving in Manitoba, we still feel that the skiing at Red Lodge makes the drive down south of the border totally worthwhile. We'll definitely be back!\n\nTip: the lift ticket is already cheap but still look for the deals to be had at Liftopia.com"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Jul,negative,3,"If you are in the area, don't pass up the drive to Red Lodge via the Beartooth pass. It is incredible and the town of Red Lodge is absolutely charming!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Apr,positive,4,"I have never in my life have stepped into skis.. My fiance is a hard core skier and his friends (who are also big time skiers) invited us to come for the last weekend of skiing at Red Lodge (We live in South Dakota-although originally from Washington State). They encouraged me to take a ski lesson and I did! I was really nervous at first and was afraid of falling. I had a wonderful instructor named Mary who was very patient and helpful. By the end of the lesson I was doing some turns. Although I just stayed on the magic carpet ( I was way to tired at the end to try Miami Beach) I was very happy with the lesson and my progress. Mary was a WONDERFUL instructor!! Please pass that on! (I'm a teacher so I know what good teaching is like) It was a gorgeous day too so that helped. I tried it again the next day but it was snowy and more icy so I didn't feel as confident. I had a different instructor too. Still, I loved my experience at Red Lodge. My fiance loved it too and said it was some of the best skiing he's done-(especially after it dumped all that snow on Sunday!) We can't wait to come back next year!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Mar,positive,4,"We brought a small group from a small school. The mountain and skiing was great, the organization of the trip was a bit more stressful than need be. We tried to get a group rate ahead of time but we're told that they had ""too many"" groups for that two days and so no discounts. It was a bit crazy and $$ but we had a good time!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Feb,negative,3,"Groomers and power runs. Very nice lodge close to the summit, but unfortunately only open on weekends. Fortunately, the restrooms ARE open all days."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Mar,negative,2,"Skied two days at Bridger Bowl, but knew that Red Lodge had received 17 inches of snow two days before, so decided to go there. Spent most of the time skiing the Palisades area. Great runs and a high speed lift. With the new snow, the rest of the ski area was great. If weather turns warm, they may lose snow fast."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Feb,negative,3,"I have never been to Montana and had a few days off work so I decided to take myself snow boarding. I am a skier but want to learn snow boarding. The drive to Red Lodge was exciting; it is such beautiful country. Red Lodge is a quaint little town with many shops and places to eat. The drive up to Red Lodge Mountain from the town is also exciting. I was particularly fastinated by the sign that requires you to have snow chains or a vehicle that can navigate the steep, often snow laden passage. I realized why on my second day to the hill as I had to climb the mountain in very near white out conditions. Which only caused me to be more excited. Once at the lodge the staff were very helpful and attentive in getting my gear, rental, and onto the slopes. I went right to the Magic Carpet (bunny hill) as my lesson did not start for another hour. The Lift Attendant (aka: Liftie), Bob was so helpful in giving me pointers to get me started. Then, my lesson with Brianna was excellent. She helped me to form a good foundation. My second day on the slopes I went up the Miami Beach Lift. It was snowing the second day so that meant very different skiing conditions. But, the tools that Brianna gave me equipped me for all conditions. I look forward to continuing to snow board and hopefully soon be able to carve like Brianna. Thank you Red Lodge. You have great employees and you gave me a superb snow boarding experience. I look forward to coming back."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Feb,positive,5,"We make it to Red Lodge every year! By far one of if not our favorite place to ski that we have visited. We skiied it twice this year and loved it again...the 2+ feet of fresh powder was amazing of coarse!! Great overall mountain with a little bit of everything, no matter what type of skier you are you shouldn't be disappointed! No lift lines and an excellent staff from ski patrol, resturant, and the gift shop employees make this a place I look forward to visiting year after year!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Feb,positive,5,"On February 17 a group of 44 middle school students from Frank Brattin Middle School in Colstrip made a ski trip to Red Lodge Mountain. Annalee was instrumental in organizing this trip, the guys in the rental shop were great and got the kids checked in and out the door in record time. We had many first time skiers and snowboarders. After their lesson they were set loose to ski and snowboard and had a really good day. Our more experienced skiers and snowboarders took advantage of the nice day and spent the entire time on the mountain. A great day was had by all."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Feb,positive,5,Have been there twice this Winter and it has been wonderful both times. It is a Huge Mountain with a small lodge feel. We have been both times on a Friday/Saturday Trip and it is definetly a busy place on a Saturday. If you are a first timer to a bigger Mountain and need some space i would suggest going during the week. Also if you are on a Budget be sure to purchase your 'Super savers' Lift tickets ahead of time. The earlier you buy the more you save. Definetly eat at the Midway Chalet or the Beirstube. Skip the Cafeteria.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Feb,positive,5,Katie is an amazing employee! She helped make my visit to red lodge better than expected! Nature isn't always far for red lodge but employees like Katie make the trip worth it!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Feb,positive,4,"We really, really loved skiing at Red Lodge! The days we were there, it hadn't snowed in forever and it was really warm. Two of the chairlifts and many of the ski runs were closed. But. BUT! The snow had really held up better than I had anticipated and we enjoyed some really great skiing on a wide variety of terrain in spring-like conditions. The snow was soft and fun. We spent a lot of time at the mid-mountain Chalet, too, where the food was better than most ski resorts I've been to! We had a blast on this mountain, and especially for the relatively low price of lift tickets, we left very happy and satisfied. This resort feels like a locals ski playground. I hope they never loose their small-town charm!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Feb,positive,4,Small Town Ski atmosphere. Great Skiing! Virtually no lift lines. Lower and mid-mountain chalets. Well groomed runs.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Jan,negative,3,"My buddy and I decided that we werent going to hit the slopes the first day. My wife and her friend stll wanted to so we decided to go hit up the bar there. That place is FUN. The food was good but the beers and the environment were awesome. They even had the Packer/Seahawk game on. Next time we are in Red Lodge I am going to hit the slopes, which my wife told me was great. No chair lift wait times really. Only problem is that the power went out and the lifts stopped working for about a half hour or so. I would recommend checking this place out whether your skiing or not!! You will have fun either way."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,negative,3,"Our 5 year old daughter got a great lesson from Ronald. We had a good time, even though the snow was pretty thin. We will be back when there is more snow. Pack a lunch, the food is expensive for what you get."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,positive,4,"Great people, great slopes and cold beer. Can't go wrong. A definite must when visiting Montana!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,negative,3,"We made a ""last minute"" decision to enjoy Red Lodge Mountain while my daughter was home on Holiday break from College-While the snow wasn't great the combined low price of lift tickets on line and low gas prices made it a great day! No lines at the lifts, food, rentals,etc-great parking and the staff was professional and courteous-It's a shame more people don't take advantage of the combined value and fun-We had a really nice Father-Daughter day that was low key, low stress,affordable, and enjoyable-I would-(and probably will) do a mid week visit to my favorite ski area again-Montana Values from a great Montana Ski destination-Thanks for the great day!-"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,positive,5,"We had a great time. It is so local and personalized. The staff were all sweet, friendly and helpful. Low prices and polite low-key skiiers. Hate to give glowing reviews because it might draw in the wrong element, but it is true! Loved it!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,positive,4,"This will be our new favorite ski mountain. $38 on-line lift tickets, incredible terrain. They just need more snow as half the runs were closed. However, grooming is top notch and the place is almost deserted. Staff is the friendliest we've ever met."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,negative,3,"The skiing and scenery were sublime, to top it off the locals and staff were very welcoming and friendly, the hospitality here is second to none."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,2,Extremely Friendly staff. The backside of the mountain was closed. Single digit temperatures outside.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,2,"Overall, this trip went well... except EVERY TIME we come we have trouble with the lockers! Took $3 from us, so we ended up just throwing our bag on top of locker &amp; hope it didn't get stolen! Grrr! Lock stuff in car!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,negative,3,"I'm a terrible skier, so take my review for what it's worth. I had great fun learning, the staff was courteous and nice, the slopes were great."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,positive,4,Had a great time at Red Lodge Mountain! The best parts about the trip were the good skiing conditions and the lessons that my 5 year old son and 7 year old niece took. By the end of the first day my 5 year old son was off the beginner hill and successfully went down a green run riding a lift to the top! He was elated and so was the whole family! The staff at Red Lodge are top notch and care about your visit to their mountain.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,positive,5,Awesome time best instructor for getting me started. On the snowboard . I have been a skier since I was 3 and have finally decided to learn he snowboarding .

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,positive,4,"We went to Red Lodge Mountain for a skiing vacation during last Christmas week. It is a nice place, quiet and neat. The mountain is not very crowed. Only half is open but the tickets were still in full price. Services are excellent, people are friendly and helpful."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,positive,4,not bad at all but yeah this mountian was pretty good for not having all the snow that they normally have
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,negative,3,Had a great time on the mountain with family. My kids are beginner snowboarders and this is a great place for them to learn and master their skills.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,positive,5,"I learned how to ski years ago by taking a lesson at Red Lodge Mountain. My boys both learned how to snowboard by taking lessons there as well. The group lessons are wonderful. It has always been a treat to go skiing there. We try to make the trip for a couple weekends a year, and have been doing so for almost 20 years. The staff are very friendly and helpful! It's so worth the 7 hour trip to ski this mountain!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,positive,4,The ski instructors are very nice and professional. My family had a great time! We went on a Saturday and didn't ever have to stand in lines longer than 5 people ahead of us. They happily slowed the chair lifts for my youngest inexperienced daughter to get on without difficulty. Everyone was very friendly. The snow was good. A few slopes were closed for not enough snow. But the majority were open. It was a great day!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,negative,3,"My first visit to Red Lodge Mountain was on a Saturday, so it was crowded with families but since there is enough room to spread out, this didn't present a problem. There were no long lines for lifts. There were lots of people in the lodge, but enough room to accommodate them comfortably. There were lots of options on the trails for skiers of all levels. The only drawback was the snow quality was not great. On the website, the base depth was listed as 18"" to 20"". I don't think I came across an area that had more than 10"" and there were large patches of dirt exposed in some of the busier areas. With a deeper base and some powder, this would be a great place to ski!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,positive,4,"Wonderful experience!! Everyone was accommodating. There was never long lines, it is obvious that this business knows how to provide great customer service and experience!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,positive,4,Had a great time skiing with my daughters. Friendly staff are always willing to help. The Beirsteub is good for relaxing with a beer and some great food.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,negative,2,"No snow, which was not fault of resort, but was treated terribly. MOST important, the only two decent runs were horrid by ski racing, one both days, one run wasn't properly signed and led us (with two 3 year olds) to black diamond runs - with NO WARNING; on the second day, we 'broke; the tape on the practice run to get our young ones down safely and were stopped and berated by the ""practice"" team. I am a former professional snowboarder, and it has been a long time since I have been so disappointed in a resort."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,3,"My most recent visit to Red Lodge, I was welcomed by 16"" of new powder! Needless to say, my day on the mountain was great. I grew up skiing Red Lodge and always love going there, even if the snow isn't good, it's a good excuse to sit in the Bierstube!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,2,"Came here with family to snowboard. Before we got on first lift, lift attendent walked passed us and said ""ugh, snowboarders"". We had a good half day, then at two pm the lift attendents started checking for leashes so wouldn't let us up the lifts unless we went to shops to buy a leash. Evidently this is a state law, but we live in Montana and have never ever had this happen and we are frequent snowboarders all over the state. The new snowboards do not need this device because we strap or foot in when we go on the lift. So no other mountain enforces this outdated law because of this reason. Would not recommend this resort if you are a snowboarder. Unless you want to spend $7 at the store for a leash (and put a ring on your boot too because they don't even make a place to put a leash on new boots)"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Feb,positive,4,We are teaching my 3-year-old to ski and Red Lodge Mountain is a perfect resort for kids. Family friendly base lodge with helpful staff and just enough terrain for everyone to have a good time.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Jul,negative,3,It is a great end to driving the Bear Tooth Highway. Perfect way to close out the scenic drive and get a few more fantastic views.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Dec,negative,3,"Small town ski area feel. Good runs, nice variety of terrain. Mostly an intermediate's mountain but there is some expert terrain if you seek it out. Lift system seems a bit disjointed but functional. Red Lodge town is fun at night for plenty of apris ski activities."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Jul,negative,3,We loved the mountain and all of the scenery after taking the Beartooth Highway(route 212) from tower junction in Yellowstone to Red Lodge. Take your time and enjoy the sites around this beautiful mountain. Great views from every angle!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Jun,positive,4,"From the drive to the mtns to how serene the campsites are...it's an impeccable place to visit! Even if you're not fond of heights, go on the switchbacks to the top...you won't be disappointed."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Mar,negative,3,Great ski classes the instructors are super nice a good variety of slopes a great little place for beginners I'll come back every year :)
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Jul,negative,3,it's really awesome small town in the valley of mountains. best to visit in summer and ski seasons. It is in the way to Yellowstone national park. It is place to take holiday from concrete jungle cities and nurture nature.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Jan,positive,4,Most of the lifts are old school and the road up the mountain is dirt - but this mountain is a blast to ski with lots of varied terrain and the snow was great even though it had been very warm for the two weeks prior to our visit.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,Best spring skiing in years! Friendly staff with lots of cold beers on tap! Not crowded at all! Excellent snow!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,4,"Great mountain for every level of skier. Personable staff that are willing to help everyone. Short lift lines, quick lift rides and amazing scenery."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,4,We were on a ski trip to Montana this past March. Red Lodge Mountain was the first ski area we visited. The staff at the ticket window were helpful. And our skiing experience was very nice.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,"If you are looking for a TRUE Montana ski experience try Red Lodge Mountain. Over the past several years I have seen skiers wearing cowboy hats and jeans, a moose crossing the road heading up the mountain and deer running across a ski run. Many days you feel like you have the place to you and 10 friends. Even when there's lots of people the lift lines move along quickly. This is a great place to have a family Montana ski vacation that gives you a ski town feel without needing to take out a loan to pay for it. If pretentious skiers is what you're looking for this is NOT your place. But if you seek a great family friendly mountain with fun runs and amazing views and is often referred to be considered a hidden gem, you found your place. A lift ride conversation here, may very well end in a long-lasting friendship!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,4,We heard from word of mouth about Red Lodge Mountain. It was all the website promised. Pure and simple. We will return.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,4,"I've been snowboarding for 5 years and this is the best place I've ever been. Excellent trails for boarding and best of all, NO LINES. The longest you will wait in a lift line is 25 seconds TOPS. And this was when they were busy in mid March."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,4,"Good variety of slopes and value for a day of skiing. Very friendly staff! Not crowded at all! Rental shop was good, too!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,"Despite a cloudy day, we had a blast skiing here. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful as we were not familiar with the slopes. The slopes were in good condition and runs were great. The only hinderance, very little visibility because of snow and a cloud was out of their control. I hope I can come back and ski there again."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,5,Red Lodge is a great ski lodge for the entire family! The staff are exceptionally friendly even at the end of their season! The chalet is nice with amazing chocolate chip cookies and the bar is a great place to rest at the end of the day to wait for the kids to come off of the mountain! The absolute best was that we had an opportunity to ski above the clouds...amazing!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,We had a great 3 days of skiing. The weather was nice and warm. Roughly 50 each day. The first day was a little icy but after that it was great. We were able to ski the entire mountain. Many of the chutes on cold creek even opened up.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,4,"We loved it! Very family friendly. Lost and found was even good to usüòè\nWe found reasonable room rates (on short notice) at the Yodeler ( which I will also review) discounted lift tickets on line, and convenient ski rentals in town (no lines!)\nWe will be back!\n\n"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,5,"We have taken our family to Red Lodge skiing on several occasions. We are from out of state, and it is a long drive, but always worth it. The prices are fair, the service is great, and there lift lines are short or non-existent. It is our 'home' mountain and we are proud to make the trek there as often as we can!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,4,"Well-groomed. Wished more runs were open, but that really had to do with lack of snow. Friendly staff!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,2,"Hard ice which made it difficult to ski, maybe a refund should have been offered or not sold ski lift tickets."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,4,Had a great time skiing. Very friendly and helpful personnel at the lifts. Food in the lodge was quick and good.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,5,"Best Staff Ever!!\nI was here from Bozeman and a ring of mine was lost somewhere between the car to the deck. I was frantic and upset because this ring meant a lot to me as my Nana gave it to me almost 10 years ago on her death bed.\nThe staff at Red Lodge went above and beyond to help me find it! They went as far as to grab an electric screwdriver and began taking apart the deck In hopes to find it!! Although we did not find i that day, I will never forget the trouble they went through to help me find it!\n3 days later, I just received a call saying it was found!! I am so thankful for all they have done for me.\nThank you Red Lodge!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,5,"every time we have been there the staff at the ski area have been great. love it when the lefties always say ""Have a great run!"" sometimes you surprise them by answering with something off the wall!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,5,"5 Stars for Red Lodge Ski Patrol! We went skiing on President's Day. The conditions were icy. My husband had only been skiing at a ""Hill"" in ND. We should've gotten him some lessons, but we didn't and he super-manned it down the mountain quite a few times on his belly. The ski-patrol was there to help, some of whom weren't even on duty that day! We tapped-out at noon, covered in snow-rash. We will be back for lessons and powder! Thank you Red Lodge ski-patrol!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,4,"There was a lot of ice areas. But, I am sure it was due to all the warm weather that had occurred the week before and then it froze. We had a lot of fun and would like to come back during better weather and ski again. The bar was fun and the food/drinks were great! The employees' were very friendly."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,3,"My 11 year old went up with some friends for a long weekend. When I asked him how it was, he said ""I'm sore"". To me that's a huge 2 Thumbs up! He also went up the triple chair and said he went off a couple boxes. He wants to go back every weekend!! Thanks Red Lodge for helping my boy make memories!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,positive,4,I would love it if Red Lodge had a childcare system for the kids that can't ski. I end up sitting in the lodge the whole day with the baby and toddler while the two older kids and husband get to ski.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,negative,3,"We visited Red Lodge over the New Year holiday and had an amazing time! All the staff employed at Red Lodge Mountain were wonderful, from the parking attendants, gift shop, snack bar, to the lift attendants. You can tell that they all love their jobs, they were always smiling and greeting us, asking how the runs are and suggesting where to go next. Thanks for a great ski vacation, can't wait to go back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,negative,3,"The terrain and skiing are good. The bathrooms in the base lodge are gross -- on par with a seedy truck stop. The base lodge is rather small and is crowded on busy days. Lifts are slow and on the latest trip one lift was running at half speed due to a mechanical issue that purportedly won't be fixed until next year. Food and beverage prices are very high, quality is average at best. The town of Red Lodge is very nice."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Dec,negative,3,We had a great time at Red Lodge skiing. It was windy one day but was awesome the others. My kids are new to skiing and they loved the good options for green runs.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,positive,4,"I thought it was a pretty awesome place. Decent snow. Very cold. Only downfall is the triple lift was a little slow. Terrain park was fun, back country was decent. Overall enjoyable"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,positive,5,"We went skiing and had a blast, the people were friendly, The food was great, The Yodeler motel was very clean and reasonable priced, The Red lodge brewing co was very good and the skiing was awesome."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,positive,4,"It was a great trip overall. Awesome groomers, awesome ski lift operators, great lodging. Wouldn't mind more park tho. Love box rails and mini kickers. Need more of them."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,positive,5,My boys first time and they loved it so of course dad love it! The staff was great and helpful! The mountain was great skiing! My boys still talk about the instructor and the lift guys! Thank you for taking care of my family for a great day!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Dec,positive,4,"Lift help was friendly, lines were short. Kids took lessons in the morning and the instructor was very friendly as well. Not a lot of snow yet but was well manicured."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Dec,negative,3,"We were at Red Lodge the week between Christmas and New Years. Lift lines were short and the staff was great. Very fun, relaxed ski area."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,19-Jan,negative,2,Mountain wasn‚Äôt groomed. Like at all. Gift shop only had huge sizes in both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs clothes. The Stube (restaurant/bar) needs to be bigger it was soooo crowded you couldn‚Äôt walk. Draft beers were good but the famous beer cheese dip was nothing special.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Dec,negative,3,Great skiing in a true Western town. Great prices for amazing skiing. Easy drive from Red Lodge up the mountain. No shuttle though
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Dec,negative,3,This is a cute mountain. Am I supposed to say cute? Haha First time I have been there. Certainly different than the big resorts in Wyoming and Utah but I liked the atmosphere. Seemed very family friendly. \nThe conditions were way different than I expected but again early season and not really knowing the mountain well we were in some runs that weren‚Äôt my cup of tea. Overall it was a good experience and if we go back it will be later in the season. \nThe magic carpet and beginning area was great!! My husband took our 3 year old down on her snowboard and the price is perfect~ free!!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Dec,positive,4,"I‚Äôve grown up in the Red Lodge area and have been skiing RLM since I was 3 years old. I don‚Äôt have enough good things to say, it‚Äôs a small community oriented mountain with big terrain. \nThere are rarely any lift lines and plenty of hidden terrain. Red Lodge has a easygoing, resort town vibe and lots of restaurants for after the mountain closes. Beginners have easy access to easy terrain and good instructors at their disposal. Intermediate will be delighted at the signature ‚ÄúLazy M.‚Äù Advanced skiers will find excellent tree skiing and steeps off of Cole Creek."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Apr,positive,4,I would highly recommend taking a lesson prior to skiing if you have never skied. Our instructors were patient and kind. I would also suggest buying a ski helmet. Our family rented skis etc and thought we could purchase helmets at the store if needed. Helmets were scarce so we went without - would not recommend. As a family we flew into Billings so we didn‚Äôt want to pack too much. Beautiful mountain and helpful staff.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Apr,positive,4,We are a family of snowboarders. We love this mountain. It has such great variety for all of us. We‚Äôll be back again. The only ding is the parking lot is nasty to drive or walk through.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Apr,positive,4,So beautiful &amp; great skiing conditions we had a blast skiing here yesterday very beautiful &amp; lots of runs from beginners to expects.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Mar,negative,2,"We visited during March of 2018 for my son to compete in a free-ride competition and unfortunately the snow conditions were poor. There was plenty of snow but we hit it after a week of warm weather and then cold temps the days were we there left the snow rock hard to icy. The lower mountain groomers were ok in the afternoon after the sun had softened them a bit. The chairs that service the area from the bottom near the lodge are S-L-O-W. Right at the base there is a triple chair, a carpet tow for the beginner area, a double that accesses easy terrain, and another double that starts a little higher up but accesses the same terrain as the triple. But once you get back in the Cole Creek and Palisades areas, those have high speed quads to move you along. The terrain would be fabulous with some fresh snow. The view from the top of the Grizzly chair is amazing, and skiing down in the Palisades area is very picturesque. So it's got a lot going for it and would be a great area with better snow. There's also a midway chalet on the upper part of the mountain that offers a nice bar and grill."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Mar,negative,3,Great little spring break trip! Would recommend to anyone who is learning or already a master! The lift operators are very nice and helpful if you need directions! The lodge is a very welcoming area with a cozy wood fireplace smell!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Mar,negative,3,"Altitude without the attitude! This is a great, no frills, skiing mountain; no lines, no crowds on the hill, VERY picturesque and inexpensive tickets! Limited options for group lessons in comparisons to other larger resorts. But, the instructor, Jake, we got for our 9 year old in a group and then in a private was excellent. \n\nFood and beverages at the Bierstube were surprisingly reasonable! \n\nAll in all, this ski resort is an excellent value!! Our family would recommend this ski resort!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,positive,4,Mountain operations does a great job daily in getting mountain ready for skiers even when they are short on snow. Fun times for sure
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,positive,4,"Bluebird day. Snow in really good condition. Good in the bierstube good, really super waitress. Love the mountain!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,positive,4,"Even though there wasn't great coverage on the upper mountain, we enjoyed the blue cruisers and mogul filled runs. The base area seemed to get a bit congested and lacked an organized system. We weren't sure if there was a line or where we should wait to get on the lift. Line separators may help with some of the confusion. We will be back as we were able to score some discounted tickets by buying in advance online."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,negative,3,Good mountain for family. A little slick but good. Why isn't there a tubing hill? Really disappointed it doesn't have one as it would be great for families. Need a bigger chalet for hanging out.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,negative,3,Had a great time with the family skiing and snowboarding. Decently priced and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Will go again for sure.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Dec,negative,3,"It was windy this particular day, so a bit of the mountain was closed. As always, though, Red Lodge is a great resort. I'm from Billings so it's close, prices are reasonable, and the people are always nice. Great time, despite the weather."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,positive,4,"This place is not a bad ski resort, but a 1 1/2 hour extra drive to Big Sky or Bridger Bowl is worth it in my opinion. I have been going to Red Lodge for at least 15 years and I have to say in those 15 years they haven't upgraded much, they added a yurt at the bottom which in my opinion was a cheap cop out to building another dining area. But that's about it. The triple chair (their main lift) is old and is always stopping, and all other lifts are old double chairs except for the back side and ""bonus area"". Those lifts are high speed quads, which is great except for the fact that those areas aren't even open half the time. Why would a ski area put all the money into something that's not open that much, doesn't make sense. I still like the ski area but every year that goes by without them upgrading anything is another year I will choose to take my family and friends elsewhere."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,negative,3,"Had a good day with the kids, the magic carpet was a little busy at times but not bad. The lines for the lifts were not bad, got right on the chair almost ever time. Just need more snow."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,positive,4,Excellent groomed trails. No lines. Bright sunshine. Spring like conditions. Snow comes by tomorrow with a mild cold front. Pleasant employees.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,positive,4,"Ski here often, lovely local mountain with small town feel and great runs. It's the type of place that has options for all skill levels."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,4,We are typically people who do not go back to the same vacation place. We love to explore new places. We had such a wonderful time in Red Lodge last year we came back again this year. This ski resort is absolutely wonderful! The people both at the ski resort and in town are so friendly and kind! You feel like you are family. The runs are great and they offer a great time for those that are just learning and for those that can handle the blacks. Pack a lunch or eat in the chalet. Either way be sure to get a chocolate chip cookie...amazing! They also have a wonderful bar for the parents to rest if they get done skiing before the kids!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,5,Unfortunately there was so much ice it was to ski on any of the runs except Miami. We didn't stay all day and paid for the entire day.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,"After traveling 900 miles from Minneapolis, I did not expect I would need a tank to navigate their terrible parking lot. Their are holes that you could lose your vehicle in..........terrible."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,"Red Lodge is a quaint, family friendly ski resort. There is something for all levels of skiers. The staff are super helpful and pleasant. We have been going to Red Lodge for 5 years and have not been disappointed with our experience. The only variable is the conditions, but they have been good 80% of the time."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,4,"We were in Billings for something totally different and decided to take our girls skiing at Red Lodge for their first skiing experience. It couldn't have been better. \n\nFirst off, the mountain is a mountain. It's 10K high, so it was everything we had also experienced in Colorado. The instructors were top notch. Very encouraging and friendly with new skiers. Our girls had never skied and were on a lift after 1 hour of great instruction. They fell a few times over the course of the rest of the day, but nothing major and all fun.\n\nThe cost was so reasonable. Way less than what we expected to have to pay. We were debating whether we'd return to Billings for the same event next spring. If we do, we might try and carve out more than one day of skiing since it was such a good experience!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,5,"Staff is great, Nice layout of terrain and good grooming. Adequate snow-making on front side of mountain, but would be much better if they had at least a few trails for each of the Quads that are installed but dependent upon adequate snow coverage. The last few years have really highlighted the necessity."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,5,Just started skiing four weeks ago and I'm hooked! Every staff member I've interacted with has been awesome! Really looking forward to next year so I can try out some bigger runs!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,4,"Our trip was planned to snowboard March 9, 10, &amp; 11 but when we arrived on the 10th, the power on the mountain was out so no lifts were running. We decided not to wait and find something else in Red Lodge to do. We contacted Liftopia and they offered 20% if you used your ticket or a different date to use a ticket. Unfortunately, we were only scheduled to be there the three days and had purchased the three days. We left out $80 which was frustrating but we had a good time while we were there."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,Red Lodge should have compensated for the power outage. Lifts turned on at 11:45. We were among the first to arrive before 9 am.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,We had a great day on the mountain with our church youth group. Everyone had fun and the snow was quite good. The Staff were excellent!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Feb,positive,5,"Had a great ski day at Red Lodge in February. Mind, the weather was in the 20's with minimum wind--a vast improvement over the negative temps the week before. The parking lot was packed but there is a shuttle. Prices were great. ($49.00 for a half day). Moutain was well groomed. Mannerly people at the sales window and on the slopes. I almost hate saying nice things because although the lot was packed, there were no lines for the lifts. We only did blue and green slopes but they were mostly great. I did get on one that was a passageway between runs. A bit narrow with a small section that was really steep. Still, had one of the most beautiful ski experiences of my life there. Can't wait to go back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Feb,positive,5,"The primary lift you have to take up in the morning is an old slow triple prone to breakage. It broke the day before we arrived and we heard people were stuck on the thing in subzero temps for 90 minutes. The lift is wind exposed and is the primary notable weak link of an otherwise great mid-size resort. It's such a sore that even the locals will tell you to ride that lift once a day and then get off of it. It's a shame as there is some nice terrain accessible from the lift that we chose to ignore except for our run down at the end of the day.\n\nOn the other hand, the Grizzly Peak old slow double is perfectly suited for where it is located. It is not a critical lift that you have to ride, and the time it takes to go up is fair for the length of the runs. No problem here. Downside is some of the nicest runs require you to finish up all the way at the base area and then you'd have to take up the POS triple again. No thanks.\n\nThey have a high speed detachable quad called Palisades which runs as a very slow speed quad. It makes no sense. We asked the lift attendant if something was wrong and he said it was actually a high speed lift ""but this is as fast as management chooses to run it."" So that was also a kick in the jewels and kept us off otherwise nice blue terrain. It was too cold to sit on that slow lift.\n\nThe shining star of the resort is the Coal Creek high speed quad. That runs at normal speed, serves epic terrain, and you can do laps on the thing all day and be entertained. Had a lot of fun off that lift,\n\nAlso enjoyed both the mid-lodge and the Stube at the bottom of the hill. Friendly ski bar with fine food, friendly bartenders and fair prices. We enjoyed the soup of the day, chili, pretzels, beers and bloodys. \n\nLook forward to coming back to the resort, but it's a shame about the Triple chair which I also don't recall having a safety bar. Being old and accident prone, it'd certainly be nice if it as least had a bar for a family friendly resort."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Feb,positive,4,"After 18 years, it was time to get back into skiing and have my 12 year old take lessons. Glad we went! Miami Beach was a wonderful beginner run (a little steep on part) but not crowded. Would definitely do the 2 hour private lesson again."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Feb,positive,4,"I took 2 private lessons. The first was great, the second time around my 1.5 hour lesson started 10 min late and ended 5 min early. Disappointing on such a short lesson"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Jan,negative,3,"I have skied 50 years. Started in Michigan in the 60's. Since then I have skied alll of Colorado ,parts of Utah and Tahoe. Stood in line a lot. Red Lodge is the quintessential ski resort. Low key , needs more quads lifts but harkens back to a time when you could take your family skiing and not go broke. Nice long runs , fast cruisers, moguls if you want. No Lines ! Walk to the parking lot bring your grille and cook out for lunch. Not a big resort at almost 17000 acres but big enough and similar to many smaller Colorado resorts. I love Vail and the back bowls but if you are near Billings and want a really nice day of skiing at a fair price go to Red Lodge. The town is perfect Western also ,low key and casual."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Dec,positive,4,"Great prices, great skiing, very short lift lines. We enjoyed 2 days of skiing here. Our kids took lessons and got their first taste of skiing. The instructors were friendly. Not sure I'd rent our ski equipment at the mountain though. The ""cashier"" made us fill out paperwork twice (unnecessarily, we came to find out), tried to charge us twice, and didn't seem to know (or maybe care about) what he was doing. I'd recommend renting equipment in town for cheaper prices and more knowledgeable staff. Other than that, we enjoyed our time at RLM."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Dec,positive,4,"Short lift lines, great snow conditions, and killer trails makes RLM our favorite! The trails offer lots of variety for family members with differing abilities yet the mountain is small enough that it's easy to meet up again--say for hot cocoa at the mid-mountain lodge. \n\nSerious skiers won't be disappointed with incredible glades and amazing expert-only areas away from the beginners. For the more cautious skier in your family, try the wide open Miami Beach or Turnpike. All of the runs offer stunning views/vistas of the Montana plains looking north toward Billings. Bring your camera! \n\nFood offerings are solid from the burritos and draft beer at the mid-mountain lodge to the appetizers and cocktails at the Bierstube. We recommend taking a pass on the cafeteria in the main lodge on the weekends--it's small and crowded and tricky to walk around in your ski boots--too many stairs.\n\nAs a three-generation family visiting for three days during the busy Christmas/New Year holiday week, we loved every minute and the mountain never felt crowded. The town of Red Lodge offers great hotels (the Pollard) and restaurants (Carbon County Steak House). Do your family a favor and skip the madness of the mega-ski resort and ski where there is something for the whole family and small enough that you can all see each other during the day."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Dec,positive,4,My 12 year old tried snow boarding for the first time. He said the lesson was very informative. He was able to do it on his own and be confident by the end of the day. The rental and lift ticket and lesson purchase was a little frustrating but got through it.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Dec,positive,4,"RL continues to offer a nice variety of runs, friendly &amp; helpful staff and great cheese fries! Affordable skiing without the lines and hassle. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area. We drive from MN annually to ski here - it‚Äôs our favorite!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Dec,positive,5,"Timed our visit perfectly for visiting on opening weekend. 3"" of fresh powder fell in cold temps the night before we went up the mountain. We drove a front wheel drive economy rental up without too much trouble although extreme caution was necessary driving on snow packed road without guard rails. Short lift ticket line and small sky shop were welcoming. Nice selection of runs open and lift lines were non-existent. Overall a nice place to ski."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,5,"Drainage and coal chute were epic! Plenty of snow, fun staff, and fantastic trail conditions. Can't wait to go back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,4,"The 1st day was amazing, however given the age of the mountain/resort I'd hope for high speed lifts for their primary lifts up the mountain, not on the smaller runs on the back side of the mountain as it is here. It's very frustrating when the lift takes longer to get up than it does to ski down the mountain. \n\nThe prices are reasonable as well as the rentals for my children. The design of the lodge and access to the lifts is a bit difficult being you have to walk UP a steep hill in ski boots to get to the kids bunny slop and any of the ski lifts. This is a huge challenge for the new skiers who aren't use to walking in ski boots. It took my son 10 minutes just to get up hill to the lift! Ultimately this is just a poor design which won't change being it's built :( If your new to the mountain this would be a nice heads up! \n\nMost of the staff was very nice as well. I'd love to see them put in at least two new high speed lifts though!!! I have skied all over the U.S and in other countries as well, so I do have a good compassion to the other types of mountains."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,4,"My family has season passes to Red Lodge Mountain and have for a few years now. The hill is great for all types of skills. My snowboarder son loves the terrain park. The staff is awesome and so welcoming! Just a great, friendly place!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,5,"We chose Red Lodge over Big Sky and for a number of reasons, I'm so glad we did. Prices were affordable and the trails were great for a beginner like me."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,5,"Awesome that all the lifts were open. it was the best skiing at Red Lodge in a long time. Snow is great, lots of runs open."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,4,RLM is so fun and the staff is very friendly. Can't wait to go again. Love to stop for beers at the mid lodge and at the Bierstube.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,4,The community is very friendly and the sites are amazing. Our rented house worked out better than expected for us.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,3,We had a great time skiing. Fresh powder both days. Meet lots of fun people. We will be back next year.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,3,"14 inches of new snow! short lift lines, very helpful staff. good lessons for the young ones, and great hard runs for the more experienced skiers in our group. very good overall 2 days on the mountain!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,4,Wonderful friendly mountain that is accessible and affordable. There is terrain for every level of skier and lift tickets only cost me $40 a day when ordered from the red lodge Web site! We will be back thank you red lodge!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Apr,negative,2,"So this part of the country has super unpredictable snow. Was a terrible season for Red Lodge, but they got this late season storm (after they closed for the season) that brought 55"" of really wet snow, so they reopened the first week of April with super cheap lift ticket prices, so we went. Had an absolute blast. My girlfriend grew up on the east coast and hates powder skiing (I know, I know, it's a point of contention in our relationship... haha) so even though there was a lot of snow, the heaviness made it more like groomed skiing. I though there was a good variety of runs (granted only half the mountain was open) and it felt like pretty good access. The snow was super sticky, but we had a blast. I can see where the skiing can be rough with little snow though. The mid mountain lodge was great with good beer specials and the perfect location really. The rental shop was very efficient and the pricing was reasonable. I really hope they can have more low price ticket days to attract people from the region. My only 2 complaints were that the retail shop was very disappointing, granted end of the season, but they didn't even appear to sell skies or anything besides some socks and sweatshirts. And The road up to the mountain is a little rough with some bad potholes. There were survey stakes all the way up though, so I would assume this is getting remedied this summer."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Mar,positive,4,"Skied with multiple family members for three days at the end of March, mid-week plus Saturday. The property was well maintained and served our family of first-time to out-of-practice-mellow skiers/boarders well; not sure what it's like for more experienced/aggressive skiers. My 12 yr old son took a beginner snowboarder lesson with Ryan, he was excellent: patient and friendly, and he had my son off of the ""magic carpet"" and riding the beginner slopes before the end of the lesson. Best of all there were NO crowds, even on Saturday the longest lift line we experienced was only 4 people deep, and the staff/crew were all super friendly. The surrounding town of Red Lodge was only minutes away and offered plenty of places to eat/drink/shop. Would love to come back next winter."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Mar,positive,5,"We had two families, four adults and four kids (14, 13, and two 12 year olds). The skiing was absolutely wonderful! Great runs from beginner to way advanced! No lines for two days...Saturday before Easter there were some lines but they went super fast and the most you waited was a couple minutes. People of RL were super friendly! Recommend bringing your own lunches but be sure to pick up the super big cookies at the lodge ... The kids loved them!!! (I am sure the RL food was good...but save some more $$ on bringing your own and much healthier.). Bring a roll of quarters for the lockers. We rented from the ski station in town. We also bought lift tickets on the RL web page...we ordered them each day around 4:30-5pm. Great deals. Couldn't believe how ridiculously cheat the skiing was. Fantastic family vacation!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Mar,positive,4,"We live in Billings, Montana which is about an hour drive from Red Lodge Mountain. We enjoy skiing here because it is close and affordable. The total snow fall by year is unpredictable so we don't buy season passes but we have bought 6-tix to save on the daily lift ticket costs. Unfortunately this year we did not time the use of our 6-tix and we only were able to use 3 of the 6 tickets. The resort decided to close 2 weeks early because of the lack of snow fall and like many years, the best snow fell in the last week that they were open with this early close date. \n\nPutting that aside, which is nature's fault not the fault of the administration, we LOVE skiing Red Lodge. There are 3 places to eat; the Main Lodge which allows you to bring your own food; the Bierstube which is more of an adult atmosphere with a patio for warmer days; and Midway which also has a patio for warmer days and is open Friday - Sundays. The food is nothing fancy and the prices are resort prices but the atmosphere is always fun and the staff are ALWAYS very cheerful and happy to be there. \n\nThis is definitely a resort that welcomes children. There is a ""Magic Carpet"" for beginners and beginner lessons. Miami Beach is also an excellent place for your young ones to get experience skiing. This year the back side was not open when we were there because there was not enough snow but the Triple Chair lift from the bottom easily accesses the Midway Lodge from where you can catch a nearby Grizzly Peak chair that takes you to both black diamond and blue runs or you can ski down green runs from Midway using Turnpike (easy wide slope), Bobcat and a few others. The Triple Chair lift is a 7 minute ride and the ski down is 3-5 minutes depending on your experience level. \n\nIt seems there are often racing events on the weekends which adds to the frivolity of the mountain. There is also a course for snowboarders and skiers to practice their jumps. \n\nAll around good times in a friendly Montana local. I just wish they had more predictable snow."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Mar,positive,4,"We love RLM! We have enjoyed a family ski trip annually since 2003! It is affordable, there is enough terrain for every level of skier and the community of Red Lodge is charming-great amenities! Check to see if ""The Palisades"" is open-RLM gets late spring snow. You usually can't go wrong with this destination for family fun!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,positive,4,We had a really great time. Even with little snow this winter the rubs were nice and groomed. Some of the lifts weren't open but the youth group still had a blast. They really liked the jumps in the terrain park. They also liked watching the racers. The lodge is nice and friendly workers. We will be planning to come again next year. Thanks for a fun youth trip.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,positive,4,WE went snowboarding with the family and had a blast. They are all willing to help and very friendly. We have been here twice and love it every time we visit Montana
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,positive,5,"Good, despite really poor snow this year. I'd go again, I love the free under 5 and free magic carpet for teaching our kids. I didn't really get to do many harder runs for that reason, but I look forward to it. Poor snow this year, and I wish the lift tickets would reflect that difficulty with access. The Lodge is kind of ridiculously overpriced and uncomfortable."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,3,"Loved Red Lodge Mountain &amp; all employees were so friendly! Our grandchildren ages 7,8, &amp; 4 years old all took ski lessons, there first time ever skiing! Instructors were great &amp; kids skiied like they have been skiing forever, adults had lessons too &amp; learned so much, forever grateful for all the wonderful memories!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,2,The Good:\nEvery employee was friendly and helpful. They seemed genuinely glad we were there. We rented equipment and it was in good condition. The mountain has a little something for every level of skier. We come to ski Red lodge from California to get away from the crowds and the cost is reasonable for our family of five. \nThe Bad:\nRed Lodge was having unseasonably warm weather and not much snow. The groomed runs were fine for us beginners though. \nThe Ugly:\nMy son hit a tree and broke his leg! The ski patrol did an absolutely amazing job putting him in a traction splint and getting him off the mountain. I can't thank them enough for their professionalism and expertise. When we were completely helpless they took over and got us to safety. \n\nWe will ski Red Lodge again. I highly recommend wearing a helmet and staying away from the trees!\n
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,5,The snow was great but we sat in the lodge until 11:30 waiting for the power to come on. We got 20% of our money refunded but sat nearly half the day. I think a half day pass would been better. We haven't been up for 2 years and were considering a season pass next year. Not sure now
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,5,"We took the young boys on two separate days, they are 9 and 7 years old. We bought the tickets online which was a nice savings. We went during the middle of the week, it was not crowded at all, we never waited in a line. The second day the quad chair was open and we really liked those runs. The chair lift is wonderful, it slows down to get on and is fast and then the run is longer. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We went on the triple chair and it loads quite fast, but they slowed it down for us, which was nice. The runs were well groomed, they had gotten some new snow. The only reason it is a 4 star, is that I wish there were a few more healthy food choices in the main lodge and maybe not quite so expensive. The nice thing is that you can bring your own lunch if you want."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,5,Had a great day on the mountain. Staff was friendly and efficient. It only took minutes to get my son's rental skis fitted and out the door. The slopes were great and we skied the whole mountain. Plenty or runs to suit the needs of all skiers. We always have a good time at RLM.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,4,"I've been coming out to Red Lodge Mountain for years now and I must say, this place is awesome! The skiing is great and the people are fantastic. It is not Montana's biggest or most luxurious skiing, in fact I stop very short of calling it ""resort"" but it is real skiing for real skiers who want a great place to ski, eat, drink, and relax with thier families! Can't wait to come back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,4,"We have been coming, for our annual Ski Trip, to Red Lodge to Ski for over 35 years. Our children grew up skiing Red Lodge Mountain and now our Grandchildren. We Love It. Nothing better than Skiing with your kids and now both our Kids and Grandchildren Thank You Gary &amp; Debbie"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,4,"A hop, skip and jump from my residence in Billings. The mountain is steep and full of fun pow-stashes when the snow is going and the winds are calmer. Easy going and helpful staff. Excellent bat staff and beer selection. Good music too! The locals are the best part! Prices for tickets are very reasonable so this makes Red Lodge a saught after MT ski destination for all age groups and families. Shred on!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,"Great weather, friendly staff. Beautiful sunny day l. Lots of activities. 90s big air competition was fun. Nothing like sun, cut off jeans and spread eagles!!!"

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,5,We hit the powder jackpot! Great three days of skiing. Red Lodge has a great staff of friendly people and the town is just as hospitable!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jul,negative,3,We drove up to the mountain. It was a gorgeous day and the views were wonderful. I imagine it is a great place to ski in the winter.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jul,negative,3,As a novice skier I enjoy the ease of riding down Miami Beach. The staff has been friendly and helpful every time we have been there. \nThe snowboarding lessons for our son were extremely helpful and affordable. They showed kindness and patience with him which made the rest of the trip even more enjoyable.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jun,negative,3,"Found it.......perfection. \nAmericans need to see this place as classic USA small town beauty and charm. 2200 residents but the town has it all.....mountain beauty, skiing, outdoor everything, at least one parade a month, gateway to Yellowstone via "" America's most beautiful drive""....according to Charles Kuralt."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-May,negative,3,"We stayed at the Red Lodge Inn in Red Lodge Montana. Daniel &amp;Tiffany are the owners, and they are very accomodating, and the rooms are very clean. We will stay there again in the near future."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-May,negative,3,"From Billings, MT to Red Lodge town (56 miles) you will see the gateway to Yellowstone Park with wonderful and unbelievable views, by Beartooth highway! Trees, snow, ice, bears! The place is unforgettable!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Apr,positive,4,Stopped by and enjoyed the bar and the view. The weather was not very good as it was snowing and blowing but still a good look.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Apr,positive,5,"This resort has something for everyone. The groomers made for ""hero"" skiing, the off piste challenging and fun, and the knee deep powder a welcomed treat in April! We appreciated the vibe, beer and food in the beer stube where we finished our day."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,positive,4,Great time and our lodging at the Cornerview was awesome! We had excellent rates at the ski resort which allowed us to take our younger grandchildren skiing The ski slopes were well groomed and our group had super days skiing. The people are all very friendly and the eating places were very welcoming. Great vacation!!!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Apr,positive,5,We boarded Sunday and Monday. Fresh powder both days and no busy lines. Everyone was friendly. Loved it as always!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Apr,negative,2,"We had a fantastic day April 1st on our way home. We were going to ski Big Sky again but the snow looked good at Red Lodge and wanted to try it. The conditions were exactly as reported and it was the best day we had all week! It is so much north facing that the steep trees were deep powder still even on a warm day. The open slopes were fine, too. It was late afternoon before it got sticky. There were no rocks anywhere. Staff was great, online tickets saved us a bunch of money compared to the big places, food good at the midway lodge. Only complaint, and this is lame, is that we had to walk up several flights of stairs after we parked because we got there late on a powder day Saturday and the lot was full. The triple is a little long and slow but Cole Creek was a great lift and all are comfortable. Plenty of mix of terrain for all of us to ski together most of the time, intermediate to advanced. Definitely worth trying for a couple days this season yet."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,2,icy Way to expensive. For what you get. If I had to do it again I would have went to Bridger bowl.for about the same money.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,4,My first time there. I just moved to the area but I was impressed with the mountain . I came here from Colorado so I am hard to please.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,3,"Has better runs than found on the east and Midwest, especially for he price. There are NO lift lines."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,3,"We like to hit the slopes here for a day, get-away. The drive is fairly short from Billings and the scenery is nice year round. The skiing conditions are really good this year, other than the warmer days of late causing some crust on the dust."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,4,I have been skiing this mountain since I was a kid. It never gets old and it's always a great time. The food is good and the staff is awesome. Plus you gotta love no lift lines.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,4,"We love Red Lodge. We've had beginners for awhile with three kids and the magic carpet is always the first stop. I love the option for a Malibu lift ticket only for the upgrade. The kids have a ball. This weekend's snow was perfect - you can't get better than Montana/Wyoming powder. Its got great options, great variety, great value. I'm a fan!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,positive,4,"We found this place by accident, and it was a great find! \n\nThere is terrain for all levels of skiing. The lifts are a bit slow but that didn't take away from the day's fun!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,3,"Great day. Haven't been to the mountain for over 20 years, just moved back to Billings. In our 50's, but think it's time to get back into it. People at the rental shack were great, mountain looks in good shape. We'll be back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Dec,positive,5,"Always love skiing RL! large enough for experienced skiers, but small enough that I can take the kids to have fun."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,positive,4,"We had a fantastic time. Loved the variety and friendly people! Although the snow was thin this early in the season, we managed to see most of the ski hill. We certainly hope to be back soon. Loved the town and got great deals on lift tickets. This ski resort has lots to offer for everyone at any skiing ability."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,21-Feb,positive,4,"I almost don't want to write this review, because I feel like I'm giving away a secret. This mountain has a lot of pitch and wonderful steep terrain (with trees) on the back side. It was an easy experience to ski here, the food services were great, and we appreciated that people were wearing masks. Heads up: make sure to reserve lift tickets on weekends and a place in the dining area--everything is limited this year because of covid."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,19-Jul,positive,4,"Skiing, hiking and mountain biking. You pretty much have the mountain to your self mid week. Remote and beautiful."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,19-Mar,negative,3,"Truthfully I was not skiing on this last visit because of an injury but my friends and my family had a wonderful time and I was super jealous as I have enjoyed skiing here in years past. The front side of the mountain is great green and blues, which our kids loved having some independence to ski on their own. The backside is for the more experienced skier and has some wicked black and double black runs that overlook the valley containing the adorable little town of Phillipsburg. But even sitting on the sidelines, I had a great day soaking up the sun, knitting and reading. I even joined an online meeting from the lodge."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,19-Feb,negative,1,Don't do kinderski unless you want your child to stand around for two hours. No one bothered to call the next day to discuss this concern as they said they would. Discussed with the owner and he made me feel bad for calling. Terrible experience. Do not recommend unless you want instructors to make your kid cry then ignore them. Incredible waste of money with the worst customer service and complete disregard for the well being of children I've ever experienced.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,18-Dec,positive,5,"We really enjoyed skiing here over the holiday. The snow was good, we never waited for a lift, reasonable prices on tickets and food. We had great weather and a very nice day on the slopes. Highly recommend for families."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,18-Mar,negative,3,"Fresh snow and uncrowded slopes and an extreme discount! We were turned on to Discovery Ski mountain by cousins who live in Missoula MT after another trip we had planned fell through over lack of snow. Discovery is just a ski area though and not a true resort. We stayed outside of Missoula and drove about 45 miles to the ski area. It wasn‚Äôt too far but I did have to drive in the snow. Next trip I‚Äôm considering renting a house at Georgetown lake near the foot of the mountain to be a little closer. The mountain has tons of trails for every level of skier or snowboarder. We didn‚Äôt have to wait in lift lines at all. Seriously never had more than three people ahead of us. There is a restaurant where you can warm up and get eats and drinks. It was very inexpensive compared to what we were used to. The workers in the rental shop, at the restaurant, and the patrol on the slopes were all very nice and accommodating. One of the children snowboarding in our group did a hard face plant. The snow patrol took him to a recovery / 1st aid area where he was checked for concussion and cleared before being allowed to continue. The rentals were inexpensive as were the lift tickets. Amazingly I returned home from this vacation with money leftover in our vacation fund! I should also add that while it wasn‚Äôt easy to find flights into Missoula MT that the airport was easy and we injoyed our time in the city of Missoula as well."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,18-Mar,negative,3,Really great rental shop staff-Chris provided awesome customer service! Thank you! \nThe mountain is amazing and we had a ton of fun. Really hated the lifts on the backside of the mountain though - definitely in need of some upgrades :)
Tripadvisor,Discovery,18-Feb,negative,3,Discovery is a fabulous place where family and friends meets to have a great time! Their kids ski classes is absolutely awesome! Their instructors are great and have lots of love for the kids! Always great to have a cookie and hot coco when the kids are done!
Tripadvisor,Discovery,18-Jan,positive,4,"We actually only skied 1/2 a day on our way to Missoula but it was still fab skiing.\nLift pass was excellent value, all the staff we met, lift operators, ski patrol &amp; lady who greeted us at the base station, were extremely friendly.\nGreat ski area with a great variety of runs all in great conditions even at the end of the day.\nWish this ski area was our local mountain"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,17-Jan,negative,3,I have been to Discovery multiple times with my kids. The mountain has runs for all skill levels and has a terrain park for snowboarders to enjoy. I have never experienced lift lines here and the last time I went the temp was -20 deg so there was only a hand full of people on the whole mountain... (no locals just crazy travelers on vacation like me) The staff at the day lodge and the lift operators have always maintained a fun and happy attitude which will rub off on you. The bar at the day lodge offered a large selection of spirits and the food served is yummy. There are nice options for lodging nearby like Georgetown Lake Lodge and Fairmont Hot Springs Resort as well as Hotel/Motel options. Your whole family will enjoy the mountain on a lower budget than the other larger ski mountains.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,16-Feb,negative,1,"The skiing itself was excellent...uncrowded and good snow. however...\n\nTheir website advertised a price of $30 for college students on the 27th of February. When we arrived they refused to honor this price, siting that it was supposed to be the 28th. When we suggested that we would not be returning the owner shrugged and said he didn't care. We felt very unwelcome and that the $1000+ we'd spent for lodging and skiing wasn't wanted...even though there were roughly 100 people there on a Saturday. BEWARE that the advertised price might not be what they ask for at the window!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,16-Feb,negative,3,"We love discovery, the way the owners treat their staff, the great maintenance and care to make it a great experience. Soup with a roll is the ticket in the cafeteria, and don't forget the awesome chocolate chip cookies."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,16-Jan,positive,5,"One of the hidden gems of the Big Sky State that only the locals know about. You will be hard pressed to beat this great value of a ski area. Low cost lift pass, virtually no waiting for chair lift, the views are magnificent and you have much room on the slopes to do your thing. Also there are a wide variety of challenging runs to explore. Food is great, too if you choose to eat there on site. Not very far to walk from the parking lot to get your ticket, either. As I say, this is a great place to ski and one of the hidden gems of Montana and the West."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,16-Jan,negative,3,"Discovery has a wide variety of terrain to suit every skier. For more advanced skiers, the terrain off the back has a nice, steep, consistent pitch with runs through the trees, wide groomers or bumps to choose from. The base lodge is nothing fancy but works well and is great for families."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,15-Mar,positive,5,"This is one of our favorite places to ski all around Montana. The hill offers the best beginner terrain in the state all the way up to some of the steepest slopes that are lift serviced off the back side, and everything in between. The location gives it consistent snow for most of the season. No snow making so they rely on natural snowfall. Prices are reasonable and there is a lot of terrain so you can find some space to be by yourself. There are future plans to expand to the North giving access directly from Philipsburg rather than having to come all the way up the hill to Georgetown. The restaurant offers a wide variety of options for lunch. Very open and cozy lodge. Well maintained area that is a great place to spend a day. Looking forward to some big dumps of snow to get the ski season rolling."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,15-Jul,positive,4,Discovery is a great family destination - the skiing is terrific for beginners and advanced. Food is offered onsite nearby. The mountain slopes are beautiful and steep.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,15-Apr,negative,3,This ski area is our family favorite place to ski. The run are wide open. People are so friends There is levels for every one skiing level. We make this trip one a year and I love every minute of it.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,15-Mar,negative,3,"I regret passing Disco Basin on I90 too many times, that won't happen again-vertical, value, terrain, high altitude snow reliability and a bowl to humble the best. Thank goodness there are low key mountain resorts like this where the roots of riding live. If you are a local, you're blessed with this gem and probably know it. Thanks for sharing."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,,positive,4,"Nice ski area with great value, great staff, good food, and lots of varied terrain. Beautiful place, don't expect high speed lifts otherwise it wouldn't be the value it is."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,15-Jan,positive,4,"Great Mountain with all kinds of terrain for families! We love it here and our kids are learning to ski here. The types of runs have allowed our kids to gain confidence and ski on their own in just 1.5 seasons. The lift staff on Sunday's is the best. Especially the staff on the Easy Chair Lift. So kind and supportive of all the people and kids learning to ski. The lodge isn't anything to write home about from a beauty standpoint, but it gets the job done. Food, hot chocolate and good beer with friends and family. Oh and its warm. You can bring your own lunch and eat it in the lower section of the lodge where there are tables and booths. The ski school staff is great, friendly and perfect for young kids learning to ski. They are all young college-age staff and so you get that type of lesson. The drive is easy from surrounding towns and your best bet is to get there early to get a good parking spot and get early runs in!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,15-Feb,positive,4,"What a fun family day on the Mountain. Our first trip to Discovery, the only bad thing I have to say is please have more signs marking your establishment, it was difficult to find or know that you were heading the right way."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,15-Jan,negative,3,"This is a great small ski hill! Most runs were open and it wasn't too crowded. Needed to be groomed but due to the rain, it was impossibile to make the conditions good. I like the small town feel and the small crowd. The bar made a great bloody mary and I heard the soups are great!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,15-Jan,negative,3,"This is a great mountain for kids learning to ski. The bunny hill chair lift is low enough that kids can ride it themselves with no problem. The restaurant in the lodge is not staffed well during weekends, so we stood in line to get lunch for 25 min. Next time, we will bring a sack lunch in our backpack or eat earlier to beat the crowds. \n\nThe ski rental place also gets really, really busy in the mornings. We recommend getting there right when they open at 9am if you are planning to rent skis because the line for rentals is super long by 10am on the weekends."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,14-Dec,negative,3,"Nothing fancy, just an all around good ski hill. No lift lines and the snow was great. Good service with a friendly staff. Reasonably priced. The lodge serves food at reasonable prices and micro brews are available. Nice mix of runs on the front side, mostly double diamonds on the back."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,14-Mar,positive,5,"This is my all time favorite ski resort. Nothing fancy.... Just great skiing, no lines.... And very reasonable prices! I spend my entire winter here!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,14-Jan,negative,3,"This is the place to be if you like short lines, wide open runs &amp; value for your money. We came from Florida with our 9 &amp; 10 year olds and they had a blast. One day in ski school, less than $100 for both, and they were riding the greens down the next day with no fear. Ski and stay packages were just under $100 for 2 adults in Anaconda. If they had ski in &amp; out on the mountain I would give the place a perfect 10."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,14-Mar,positive,4,"My wife and I recently moved to Anaconda and are really psyched to have this incredible amenity so close by. Discovery is not Aspen or Sun Valley, thank god. Varied terrain, thoughtful and friendly staff, great food, and just a good vibe. Also an incredible value. Prices for lift tickets, equipment rental, lesson, food, etc. are beyond reasonable. My wife (who had never skied in her life) took a private lesson with Becky and was making turns at the end of the first hour. Becky was very professional and made the learning process smooth and fun. We have already bought season tickets and look forward to spending a lot more time on the mountain."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,14-Mar,positive,5,"We enjoyed a wonderful day skiing with family who live in Anaconda. The value ($40) is fantastic. The facilities are simple, the chairlifts rather slow, but the terrain is great and varied. Sadly, many of the runs end with a long flat ski-out to the lift - a problem if there's a lot of snow. Very friendly staff."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,14-Jan,positive,4,I thought it was really nice of Discovery to run the lifts for me when I went to visit them on Tuesday and Wednesday. There were a couple locals on the front side of the mountain but I felt like I had my own private ski resort for two days! The terrain on the back side was amazing and even though it didn't snow while we visited I was still finding powder stashes two days after the last storm. The grooming on the front side is crazy. I don't think I have ever skied on a groomed run as steep as sluce box. How do they even get the cats up that hill? I don't know that I could spend a week straight skiing here but for a couple of days it is definitely worth the forty dollars I paid for the lift ticket.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,13-Feb,positive,5,"Discovery is very cool. Fun, lively, friendly, local vibe. The front side of the mountain is entirely covered in groomers for those in the beginner and intermediate levels. The terrain park is good for the type of resort that Discovery is. The staff are mostly all friendly individuals. The back side of the mountain is super awesome. Laced with double black diamonds, it is super fun to ski. It's especially awesome on power days because there is no grooming on the back side. The only problem is the positioning of the lifts forces you to hike a little ways in certain situations. But the food was good, and the prices for everything were reasonable."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,17-Mar,negative,3,"Well, we caught Disco with plenty of snow and sunshine for our 3 days in early March. Grooming was better than in the past. What a great ski hill. Folks have no idea how big thia place really is. Exceptional value."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,17-Feb,negative,3,"We have skied all over the Pacific Northwest and find that Discovery is our favorite. We are weekday skiers so find that we can ski right up to the lift and make another great run. The groomers do a stellar job of smoothing the slopes and the broad expanses on many runs make it seem like you have the hill to yourself. \n\nI am a blue, blue/black level skier and my partner loves the black runs. We both find plenty of areas to satisfy without getting bored.\n\nThis ski area can ""absorb"" lots of skiers without it feeling cramped or crowded. We are so impressed we plan to get a season pass for the 2017/2018 season."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,17-Feb,positive,4,"We love skiing at Discovery Mountain, the views are breathtaking! The cafeteria makes the best chili bowls and the price won't hurt your pocketbook. We ended the day staying at The Broadway hotel in Phillipsberg, MT."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,17-Feb,positive,4,There are several great cross country ski trails at the Ski Area. There is a separate parking area for cross country trails before you get to the main ski parking lot. This separate parking area allows access to trails on both sides of the road. Most of the trails were groomed as we skied.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,16-Dec,positive,5,"If you like skiing, you owe it to yourself to try Discovery when you're in Montana. It's a little off the beaten path, but you won't regret driving the Pintler Scenic Route to get there. Amazing steeps on the backside on a powder day."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,17-Jan,positive,5,"We had a great time at Discovery Ski area as part of a ski and stay package at Fairmont HotSprings. We loved the mountain though there was not much snow it was still groomed and fit our needs. The kids both did lessons which they enjoyed but was a little hectic on checkin for kinderski (I think they aren't used to being that busy, it was a holiday weekend) my daughter loved it. They somehow lost my sons reservations (which was strange because they were booked together) then they made us wait in the rental line which was 40 minutes long and made him late for the class. He was grouped with kids much younger than him and he said it was really slow moving...it was only his second time skiing so Im sure this is why they put him in this group but dont feel that we got what we paid for with his lesson. I must say that the person who we did get at the rental line was great and once we told him we were sent over there and had to wait in line he got my son right through so he could make it to his class asap. He even followed up with me to make sure he made it. I was impressed. All the guys (minus the one that misinformed us to get in line) were awesome and moving as fast as they could to get through the line. I would like to visit Discovery again on a non holiday weekend as I think that we might have had a very different expierence."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,16-Dec,positive,5,"About ten years ago, after watching a segment of the NBC television program ""The Today Show"" I booked a flight to Missoula and ""discovered"" Discovery Mountain, just a few miles from Philipsburg Montana. As a lifelong skier I yearned to find a mountain that I felt I could ski till I was ninety and not be bored or disappointed. Disco, as the locals call it, has not disappointed. If you feel some nostalgia for the simpler days of skiing, where every run brought a sense of wonder and joy, without the glitz of a hundred dollar plus ticket, and a view that stretches for what seems a hundred miles give Disco a try. True, the lifts are slow, the amenities somewhat sparse, but that adds to the charm of an area whose values are that of a family, yet whose back side slopes are as challenging as any I've skied in sixty plus years. The spirit is willing but the knees are weak. \n\nDiscovery has slopes for every skier, the extreme to gentlest of beginners and rates that can't be beat. The cafeteria is more than adequate and the bar serves local beer. The nearby accommodations range from modest to The Ranch at Rock Creek a Relais et Chateau, ""guest"" ranch, a five star ultra exclusive venue. In between options are the very unique Broadway Hotel, and a newcomer The Caledonian Inn, both charming and a good value, I have enjoyed stays at both. \n\nBut I digress, for it was Discovery that prompted my move to Montana and it is Discovery whose slopes never fail to delight that keeps me here, in the Flint Creek valley in the shadow of the Pintler Range. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. You might even end up moving here, but then again don't. I prefer an empty endless slope of powder, with a bluebird sky alone."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,16-Jan,positive,5,"Great ski area for Southern Montana. My husband really enjoyd his day of skiing. The lodge has a shope for mittens, hats and gloves etc. and yu can rent skis there. Several trails from beginner to diamond. Great day!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,16-Mar,positive,5,"I always enjoy making a trip to Discovery regardless of the conditions. The terrain is great, it often feels like you have the whole mountain to yourself, and the lifties are always smiling... But this trip, I finally lucked out and got two days of POW! I wish I didn't have to leave!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,16-Mar,negative,3,"Was here for a ski race. Race was well run even though the snow wasn't cooperating. Great value and family vibe. Better food than Big Sky's cafeteria. And, as is typical in Montana, everyone was nice."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,,negative,3,"This is a great place to learn, a beginner and for kids/family. They pay attention to the slopes. If you see something wrong, or someone who may be hurt they are on top of things. Great place for a day out!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,12-Jan,negative,3,We took our 6th and 7th grade classes to Discovery for a field trip and it was excellent. It was not crowded at all and the rates were reasonable. There are plenty of runs and they have some jumps for snowboarders. The lodge was spacious and had plenty of food and tables.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,11-Dec,positive,4,Lots of beginner terrain. Crowds are not too bad.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,,positive,4,Discovery is montana skiing at it's finest!\nLocal family owned &amp; very affordable.\nGreat skiing for all levels\nBeginner intermediate &amp; advanced are divided up by area \nAlso great lessons &amp; programs for kids\nWe have been skiing here for years &amp; love it\nNo lift lines\nGreat views\nGreat skiing!
Tripadvisor,Discovery,11-Feb,positive,4,"We skied Discovery Basin this winter again, and we like the place because of the short lift lines and the friendliness of the operators and staff. Spring skiing is better than pre-New Year's Day.\n\nLift tickets are inexpensive for a half day at $29. If you have a pass from any other Montana ski area you get the full-day pass for a half-day rate. And seniors 65+ ski for $19. We like that!\n\nThe chalet is redone with on-premise burgers and salads and the bar is always good."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,11-Mar,negative,2,"Went on Sunday, March 6... had to park over 1/2 mile away, 5-10 min liftlines on painfully slow lifts at base area, old snow, poor grooming, and alot of walking to get to runs off the top. Not what I expected from a small MT ski area that was hyped to be alot of fun and empty.\n\nterrain on the back looked great.. nice and steep, but only if you hit it on a powder day, as it was all bumped and/or scraped off. Groomers were scraped off and inconsistent texture..\n\noh, and the line for the mens restroom was 8 deep.. while people were dressing their kids in the stalls and tightening their ski boots.. reminded me of CA on this day. Not fun.\n\nThat being said, I bet it's a much better experience on a less busy day and with good snow.. so give it a shot if in the area, but don't drive 2 hrs just to go there like we did."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,,negative,3,Great lift ticket prices. Kidsa had a great time. Small lift lines. Will go back!
Tripadvisor,Discovery,12-Dec,positive,4,"Lift tickets, rentals and food are all very reasonable price. Lots of different runs, including double black diamonds. Even their busiest days does not require more than a few minutes wait to get on a lift. Very family friendly"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,13-Mar,positive,5,"Discovery Ski Area is well known in Western Montana for the great variety of ski runs it offers and family atmosphere. Discovery has great cruiser trails and also offers very steep expert terrain. You'll find something for everybody. Nearby lodging is limited, but many people enjoy staying in nearby Philipsburg, Anaconda, or Fairmont Hot Springs. You'll always have a great day of skiing at a reasonable price at Discovery. Oh, and season passes are about the price of three days of skiing at the larger, more crowded resorts."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,13-Mar,positive,5,"For $40 bucks, its an amazing deal for the acreage, the long runs, and variety of terrain. You can run down double blacks all day on one chair, or cruise along several of their long groomed blues. The lodge is wide open up top so its not hard to find people, but on the flip side they really don't have a 'bar scene'."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,13-Feb,positive,5,"We learned to ski here 25 years ago when it was $9?a lift ticket. Now after a week in Fernie BC we drive through for old time sake. Still great snow , long runs with perfect conditions and no lines to get on. All that for $40 lift tickets. The best skiing secret in USA ."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,13-Feb,positive,5,Super Friendly Staff. Beautiful views and long runs. Uncrowded slopes. Great prices. No lift lines. Great food. Great lodge. Good access.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,13-Jan,positive,5,"We spent a day at the Discovery Ski Area recently, and while a couple of us choose not to ski/snow board, those that did had a blast. There are several runs to choose from for all skill levels and ski/snow board equipment rentals are available. The cost is average for this type of activity. They could use a few more toilets and sinks in the restrooms to cut down on the line a bit. The eating area, while fairly large, was jammed packed with an outrageous line between noon and 2:30 or so, and it seemed the staff were a bit slow. I observed one gal barbequeing burgers that handles the money and the burgers one right after the other with her bare hands; no gloves, and no hand washing. That was a bit disturbing to me. The food in my opinion was a bit over priced, but I guess that is to be expected when you go to a place like this. There appeared to be adequate parking. They had a fairly large deck with outdoor seating for those needing to rest a bit but wanting to enjoy the action. The view was outstanding. All in all, it was a beautiful day."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,12-Feb,negative,3,"If you want great skiing without a big expense, head to Discovery. It is a bargain from lift tickets to food in the restaurant. You can find any kind of terrain at Discovery. Just remember double black diamonds ARE double black diamonds."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,12-Mar,negative,3,Loved that it was very kid friendly and not at all crowded. Prices very reasonable.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,11-Dec,positive,5,"This is the Mountain we snowboarded on and we totally fell in love with it, we love to do a few hours of boarding and a few hours of drinking and this was just perfect we boarded till 2 or 3 then went and had some of the best Clam chowder I have ever had ugh it was so dang good I think its because they used dill. I think about that chowder all the time. After the AMAZING chowder oh I forgot to mention the BEST chocolate chip cookie I ever had it was like a mix of a muffin and a cookie together it was thick and moist and chocolity! After all the food we sat at the bar and the bartender was so nice! She was super kind and friendly we loved Discovery!!!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,12-Mar,positive,5,"Never, ever, ever a line, affordable tickets, not crowded and nicely groomed. There's everything from nice, wide cruisers to double black diamond, through-the-trees teeth rattlers. It was the best skiing ever and we actually stayed a day longer it was so good. Don't bother with the expensive places if you really want to ski - this place has it all!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Jan,positive,5,"Overall it was a very good resort by our limited standards. The lifts were all running, the equipment and facilities were on par with most of the bigger ski resorts also. We only had an afternoon to get a few runs in and being so close we were able to not waste time driving to and from the bigger resort at Big Sky."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Mar,positive,5,What can I say GREAT place for anyone who loves the outdoors. Skiing is awesome! Their instructors are all awesome. Just a short drive from Bozeman.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Jan,positive,5,"Basic Info: Adult lift tickets for a full day are $49, although it's only $40 if you buy your lift ticket after 12:30 pm. Lift tickets for children and seniors are cheaper. The slopes close at 4 pm, at least on Fridays. The main lodge has a cafe, and there is a small gift shop located inside the rental office. Both lodges have locker rentals for 50 cents, and full-sized seasonal lockers are available for season rental. The parking lot is much larger than I expected, but after my visit (on a Friday afternoon) I realized that the place is probably packed on the weekends, with parking spots hard to come by. \n\nIf you are any skiing experience, you might as well skip the rest of my review because I am far from an expert skier- more like a good skier that is now many years out of practice. But Bridger Bowl has lots of slopes to choose from. There is a bunny slope which is fairly flat, but also very narrow considering it's full of kids learning to ski and people trying to figure out how to turn left and right. But it's a good place to get started. Sunnyside Trail is probably the next easiest trail. After that, they seem to get slightly more difficult, and I'm not going to presume to be able to rate the difficulty or comparability since I consider myself to be a novice (again)."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Feb,positive,4,"We love skiing Bridger Bowl! We usually only go skiing once a year (no hills near Fargo, ND!), and used to vary trips between Bridger Bowl and Big Sky/Moonlight. Bridger is obviously a smaller ski resort than Big Sky, but for the price and the customer service, it's hard to beat, especially if you use the Powerhound Package deal. There are a good variety of runs for Beginner and Intermediate skiers, and it looks like there are good runs for experts too, but we don't go on the expert-only lift up to the ridge (as I mentioned, we ski once/year!). There are a few black runs you can access from the mid-mountain lifts, so you can have a little adventure without committing to something crazy. The skiing at Bridger is always good, but what really stands out is their customer service. I'm not sure what kind of customer service training they do there, but it works! Everyone from the reservations people (so helpful!!), to the rental shop guys (again, really helpful), to the lifties (always in a good mood), to the servers in Jimmy B's restaurant (great service - especially from Larry!) are happy and helpful and glad you are there. Even the guys in the first aid cabin are great. Even if you don't need them, they have cool t-shirts for sale to support the rescue dogs! We also enjoy the other skiers at Bridger - they attract a much more friendly, down-to-earth crowd than Big Sky. If you fall down and have a ""yard sale"", there are always a bunch of people stopping to help and making sure you're ok. Embarrassing, but nice! Another nice advantage to skiing Bridger is staying in Bozeman. Lots of good restaurants, cool college town vibe, awesome co-op, etc. There are also a variety of nice places to stay at varying price points. We prefer the C'Mon Inn for the nice rooms, breakfasts, and multiple hot tubs. Hope you enjoy your time at Bridger. Tell Larry at Jimmy B's we said ""hi""!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Jan,negative,2,"Dress warm for this gem in the rough. Don't get me wrong I love the mountain it just needs a few fixes. Please add a buss from the parking lots well below the base lodge. add a high speed lift from the bottom so that when the wind blows (and it always blows) you get out of it faster. And lastly fix your anamometer, If I had known it was actually 20MPH I would not have driven up, I would have gone to nearby Yellowstone's North end."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Mar,positive,4,"I would rather board up at Big Sky, Moonlight, or Discovery any day over Bridger. Once I learned the mountain I began to like it, a few years ago when I lived in Bozeman I was really not a fan of it, but it is decent."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Jan,negative,3,"Bridger is a decent mountain that is only 15 miles from downtown Bozeman. There is a good sized bunny hill for the beginners and lots of intermediate terrain. For the more extreme skiiers, bring your transceiver and shovel to hike the ridge."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Dec,positive,4,Terrain for all level of skiers. Friendly staff and lots of fun! Highly recommend for families or anyone who likes to ski.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Jan,positive,5,"This place is is about 60% of the cost of nearby Big Sky. It's obviously a much smaller place, but it's fun and a great opportunity to try a different hill."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Dec,positive,4,"Writing a review for Bridger Bowl is difficult for me. After all, I'm a local and I go there. So really, I don't want to see it get any more crowded. But you just can't keep secrets these days.\n\nTo me, Bridger is like a throwback to the ""good old days,"" in that the place just seems down home and old-fashioned, which appeals to lots of folks. Of course, some of the ""good old days"" includes riding on ""old-timey"" lifts that take a long time to get up on the mountain. The Powder Park, Virginia City and Pierre's Knob lifts are all very slow.\n\nHere are my main recommendations for having a great time at Bridger: 1) If possible, don't go on the weekend. If you do then be sure to get there early since the parking lots fill up and you can expect to spend 15-25 minutes just unloading your gear, driving way down to find a parking place, then walking all the way back up to the lodge. You will also find annoying lift lines at the base at the Powder Park lift. 2) Don't go on a rather cold day. This is because the lifts are so slow and you will freeze sitting on them while you crawl up the mountain. Also, when it is busy, the lifts frequently stop and it seems to take a while to start back up. Not fun when it is 10 degrees and the wind is blowing (as it was yesterday while I was there). 3) Don't expect any deals if you have kids in the junior age range. I took my grand daughter who is 13 and had to pay full price. 4) Don't expect any deals if you are a ""senior."" Bridger doesn't give you a break until you are 70 years old. Most resorts I'm familiar with start the discount at around 65.\n\nIf you go to Bridger after some fresh powder it is fantastic. If you go on a weekday when it is not too terribly cold, you will have a great time. The base lodge and mid-mountain lodge are nice to duck into to warm up and get a good meal. Recommendation: it is MUCH easier to find a chair and table at the mid-mountain lodge than at the base on a weekend.\n\nHave fun!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Feb,positive,5,"The wide variety of terrain is what makes this hill a wonderful \nDestination!! No accomadation on the hill, there is a 20 min.\nDrive from Bozeman each morning.\nA great hill for all levels of skiers.\nNice restaurants, and 2 bars to choose from."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Feb,negative,3,A little bit of everything makes this an enjoyable experience for beginners to experts. Very nice choice of places to eat and drink as well.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Feb,negative,3,"Do not be fooled by the low price (1/2 of Big Sky) this is THE place to ski, weather you want steep and deep or first time terrain. Friendly natives and a great trip. No housing and you ned to drive back to Bozeman each day (16 miles)"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,positive,5,"8 lifts -- all modern. The ski rental people are super nice and helpful. If you are an intermediate or beginner skier this place is made for you. If advanced, there is a special area for you- if you are aptly equipped. Prices were awesome today $52 for a full day adult ticket!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Mar,positive,5,"We can never get enough of Bridger Bowl! Coming from the east coast you never know what the conditions are going to be but out of the few powder days we ever had most were here. Inexpensive, beautiful mountain with gorgeous snow."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jan,positive,5,"Great trails, no lift lines. Conditions were not the best as they had not had new snow. Will definitely be back."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jan,positive,5,The snow when we were there was excellent. There is a very good choice of runs for all levels of skiers. There are also an abundance of lodges both at the base and on the hill. The prices are the lowest of any ski hills in this class.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jan,positive,5,"Bridger Bowl is a class act from beginning to end! I have skiied for nearly 40 years at many resorts throughout the U.S. I regularly ski in Colorado. My experience at Bridger was the best. Everyone I met was friendly, helpful and professional. The skiing was awesome, helped by almost a foot of new powder, but that seemed to only be the icing on the cake. There were no lines - on a powder weekend day!!! There was plenty of variety, and easy to find the way to the various lifts and ski areas. The rental shop, especially the manager, were the best I've seen. Thanks for a great time. I'd go back to Bridger before Big Sky anytime."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Feb,positive,4,"This is another ski hill we hit on our Montana trip. The entire lower part of the mountain is dedicated to blue and green runs while the top of the mountain is almost exclusively blacks. As a beginner, I appreciated the variety of blues and greens. The blues at Bridger do not seem as steep as the blues at other rocky Mtn ski hills I have been to. My favorite run was Alpine Return/Timmys Road/Summer Road. When skied together, this run will take the better part of 15-20 minutes. And the best part is that you get challenging and fun terrain for the low price of $52 for a lift ticket. That is over $50 less than Big Sky (not that these ski hills are even close to being the same class though). All in all, we had a very fun day at Bridger."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Dec,negative,3,Ski instructors are very good and again their prices are very reasonable. There are enough ski options on the mountain to make it adventurous without being overwhelming.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Jul,negative,3,"We have been to Big Sky skiing several times and had great skiing. A friend suggested we try Bridger Bowl for a great day of skiing, and we were so glad we took their advice. \nAlthough it is a relatively small ski area, don't let that fool you,.\nThey get great powder, and there are long runs for every level of skier. \nBridger Bowl is such a short drive from Bozeman, we enjoy staying there and being on the ski hill soon. Wouldndefinitelynrecommend to any level of skier."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Feb,negative,3,"Bridger Bowl is certainly the best ""local"" ski area in the Rockies, and perhaps in the country. The ""cold smoke"" powder days, although rare, cannot be forgotten. Bridger has runs ranging from beginning to extreme (i.e., hike up to the ridge with a partner and other equipment). Bridger has been featured in several movies.\nDon't tell anyone about Bridger because the lift lines are still usually short-to-none, and this is a non-profit ski area: The lift tickets are very reasonable.\nThere is no lodging at the base, although the food is very good. You have to drive (or take a bus) from and to Bozeman, about 20 minutes. Big deal! This is not like Big Sky and/or Moonlight Basin, which are about 45-60 minutes from Bozeman. You might want to ski both areas and compare the experience. The people you meet at Bridger, including locals and others from distant places like Minnesota, North Dakota, and Canada, are usually very friendly and entertaining, at least for a ""local"" like me. Many of my best memories are from Bridger Bowl."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Dec,positive,4,"We holidayed in Bozeman in December 2011 and had a day skiing at Bridger Bowl. Staff were super helpful to my party of 8 Aussies who didn't ski or have the right gear! Youngest 10 year old benefitted from ski lessons with her own personal trainer. While only a fee ski runs, we had a full day of skiing and the cafe sold superb warm food. Looking forward to returning in 2013."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Feb,positive,5,Such an easy place to enjoy a day of skiing. Plenty of challenge but not the big resort attitude.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-May,positive,5,Sooooo close to town; only 15 minutes away it is a hidden treasure!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Nov,positive,5,"Varied and challenging terrain. No attitudes, just friendly people having fun."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Feb,negative,3,"We added a ski day at Bridger Bowl before heading to Big Sky for a week,and are SO glad we did! It ended up being the 'best day of the year' per one of the regulars there--lots a fresh powder and great conditions. It was actually the best powder skiing day of our week. It was a busy Sunday but lines weren't bad at all. The ticket prices make this a super value. We talked to a family in the clean lodge (good rest rooms) and they absolutely love their local ski spot. We did too--there's something there for everyone!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Feb,negative,3,Right from the first phone call to book a trip the ladies were friendly and easy to work with. We made multiple changes on our itinerary and never had an issue. There were no surprises when we arrived other than the depth of the powder that we had to plow through on the hill. We were at Bridger for 4 days and it dumped snow every day. This was one of the best snowboard trip trips I have made.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Mar,positive,4,Greatest ski resort in the USA - cool people steep runs and cold smoke.....
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Feb,positive,4,After a foot of new snow overnight skied Bridger Bowl on a bluebird Montana day. Whille it was crowded for here..I still had fresh tracks at noon in 3Bears Bowl. \nThe 'cold smoke' is legendary dry powder that makes skiing memorable. It is a quintessential Rocky mountain ski resort without the glitz and glamor...just honest pricing and incredible skiing.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Dec,positive,5,"My 12 year old son had 5 days of private lessons twice daily. We really got to know John Saam. He has awesome people skills, and helped him go from learning to stop and turn to spending the last two days on Green runs. My son developed confidence in his ability to ski. I followed close behind. If you want to learn to ski and are headed to Bridger Bowl. John Saam is a must! You will love his style &amp; patience.\n\nAs well, you will love the women in the Ski School office. Peggy, Jennifer &amp; Shannon are fantastic. Fantastic week!!! Remember, John Saam - The King of all that's skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Dec,positive,5,"From the staff to the slopes, this place is one of the best kept secrets! The lift tickets are reasonable compared to other area ski places. The ski/snowboard rentals were fairly priced as well. Many slopes to experience and explore. We did not get bored skiing/snowboarding here and we skied 4-7 days. We had a personal dilemma that the staff handled so kindly and professionally. It was a great experience!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Oct,positive,4,"Our University hosts took us out to Bridger Bowl for dinner as part of our site visit. The place was remarkably empty (not snowy enough for skiing and too snowy for summer sports), so we had the place to ourselves. The lodge was a good dinner venue, with considerable variety in beers and plenty decent food. I'd like to see it in full operation at some point."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Aug,positive,5,"We were guests at a private affair in late August. The food was excellent, bar choices ample, and the ambience lovely. The room is spacious enough to hold a couple hundred guests and we were by no means crowded."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Aug,negative,3,"What a find. I‚Äôm recommending this quaint ski destination to my sons. How nice to find a family friendly resort that isn‚Äôt so mammoth you feel like you are competing with the world. Only 16 miles up the hill from Boseman, many lifts to offer variety. Wish I still could ski and I‚Äôd definitely go back."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Jan,negative,3,Had a pass this year and was absolutely blessed. The beauty is unsurpassed. The runs are so outstanding. The people are lovely. The warming huts are inviting and a great place to visit. You won't ski many more wonderful places.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Apr,positive,4,"Great place. I took the group lessons both sessions . The teachers were amazing , patient, kind, talented and fun. The kitties were polite, bathrooms clean. It certainly had plenty of skiing for our family. \nBeautiful scenery and close to town. For me it was wonderful. \nThe restaurants had decent prices and food was fine- typical pub food. Great beer selection too."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Mar,negative,3,"I dislike all the big mega resorts with their arrogant attitudes and exorbitant prices. If you feel similar go to Bridger Bowl. It is only 16 miles outside of Bozeman, but you do not see the resort until you are about 0.5 miles away. It has the most natural appearance and feeling of all resorts I have visited. There is ample amount of skiing terrain for the majority of skiers for a few days and if you are an expert, you just hit the jackpot. Don't forget your avi beacon if you decide to go to the expert level ridge terrain. Food prices are reasonable with hamburgers at $4 and great taco salad at $10. Tasty food as well.\nOnly con is that it aims for local clientele. Very few signs and directions at resort of where to go to park, drop off area and how to go to hit slopes, etc. Hey, but if I must act confused or ask questions so be it. Loved this place."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Dec,positive,4,"I got to know Bridger Bowl when I was in graduate school years ago. It was a quick 20+ minutes from Montana Hall to the mountain. The hill offers some tough terrain, some good moguls, a park at the top, and lots of diversity. Further, Bridger Bowl was the home many years for the college national downhill skiing championship. People are friendly, the skiing is good, and it's reasonably priced. Try Bridger."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Mar,positive,5,My daughter and I went here and took some lessons. The staff from the very beginning were so nice to deal with. They made sure we had everything we needed and were very nice. The pricing is very fair especially for people who are just starting the ski journey. Overall we had a great time and were impressed with the service here. We would recommend this place to beginners for sure.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Mar,negative,3,"We skied here 1 out of our 4 days skiing and enjoyed it more than Big Sky. For $47, you can't beat this as compared to $81 for Big Sky ($77 online). Nice little place, but after a day we had skied most everything.\n\nIf you're in the area, you need to try out Bridger Bowl."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Jan,negative,3,"Value was decent at $50 for lift ticket and $25 rentals. Good variety of skiing. Dining options were good considering this is a community owned ski area.\n\nLift guys could possibly be a bit more courteous since we arent all expert skiers. A few miles outside Bozeman but no big deal, just be careful driving if very early in the mornings."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,positive,4,"I've skiied Bridger Bowl in 2001, 2003 &amp; 2006. This place never fails to please with great snow and short waits in line. I've skiied a few places in Tahoe and the East Coast, plus a few in Montana--Big Sky &amp; Moonlight Basin--but Bridger is always my favorite. The lift ticket price is reasonable, the locals who frequent the place are so friendly and the staff is very cool. This ski slope has something for everyone from beginner to expert and it's not far from downtown Bozo. If I had to pick a place to go back to over and over again, I'd pick Bridger Bowl."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,positive,5,"My husband, two sons (ages 9 and 11) and I visited Bridger Bowl and skiied for four days over the New Year's holiday. We researched this place on Trip Advisor and their website and it looked like a low-key, family friendly place for beginning skiers. Well, we were right!\n\nWe're used to skiing in California, which is generally crowded when the conditions are good. But at Bridger there was never a line, the snow was amazing, everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful, including the other skiers, the prices were very reasonable and we had a fantastic experience.\n\nI especially recommend this place for families with young children who are looking to introduce them to skiing. The staff-to-patron ratio is amazing. My kids and I took a ""group"" lesson and we each got our own instructor. My older son decided to switch from snowboard to skis on the second day - no hassles. We just went to the rental shop and they swapped him out. There is a very good selection of runs for the very beginning to the very advanced, so those who want more of a challenge won't be disappointed. The lodges have good food, reasonably priced and are really clean and scenic looking facilities. The mountain views are beautiful.\n\nThere isn't much loding immediately adjacent, but there is plenty of lodging in Bozeman, which is just 16 miles away. The drive is an easy one and the road is always plowed. There is also a bus that will take you to Bridger from Bozeman for free if you don't want to drive.\n\nI really can't recommend this place enough."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,positive,4,"Awesome! i'm the worst skier ever, yet i had a blast. this is a must for everyone! skis and snowboards are available at amazing rental costs. bring your warm clothes 'cause it gets chilly! have fun!\n"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,positive,5,"From begining to end Bridger Bowl is the best and least expensive ski area in MT. I've been to Big Sky and Bridger and if you're interested in some serious powder runs without the crowd hassle, got to Bridger Bowl.... It's Awesome..\n"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Jun,positive,5,We visit from Minnesota and love skiing at Bridger Bowl. Variety of skiing types and difficulty for the family. Moderately priced and clean lodges. Staff are helpful with great ski instructors!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,positive,4,"Great value! Ticket prices are reasonable, food and rental options are great, and just 16 miles from Bozeman. Highly recommend this beautiful ski area!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Jul,positive,4,"Attended son's wedding in July 2012, held at the mid-hill lodge. Easily accessible facility big enough for several hundred at least. Tables, chairs, etc included in the rental fee so you don't have to rent and haul them. Catering also did a great job. A most ""Montana"" place that our out-of-state guests enjoyed. Only caution: warn your guests to bring flat soled shoes to wear if the ceremony is held out on the deck, which is made of grating (so that snow will fall through during ski season). The grating eats high heels!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Mar,negative,3,"We have had mid-week season passes to BB for the past several years. When we first arrived in Bozeman, I thought, well, we might ski here occasionally. But skiing one or two days a week all season really improved our skiing. The treed routes (they are not official runs) are what MAKE the mountain for us. And of course, there is always the Ridge to move up too, once you get good enough."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,negative,3,"Large variety of trails. Cheap and very friendly!!! Good food, only 20 min away from Bozeman. Love it,"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Feb,negative,3,"nice skiing, and not with the 'be there and be seen' crowd. You want to ski or look good? go for the skiing. Lines at the lifts are not horrible. Go for it!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Aug,positive,4,Food was fantastic and the area was easy to get to - right out of Bozeman - if I were a winter sport person - I would visit Bridger!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Aug,positive,4,Went there to hike outside Bozeman. Easy to get to off of Rte 86. Well marked entrace and it can be as leisurely or as strenuous as you like. Have a good time but bring plenty of water!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Aug,positive,4,"Bridger bowl is probably not as elite as Big Sky, but it's so much fun. Snow wasn't great this year and was glad we didn't go... hopefully this year."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Jul,positive,4,"Bridger Bowl claims its a world class community ski hill. It delivers everything it promises. Granted I might be bias seeing how this is where I learned to ski, but it offers something for every level of Skier. Alpine Meadows lift is the perfect lift for folks just learning. Slushmans is every skiers backcountry wet dream. Only down side to Slushmans is lines on powder days. If your in Bozeman for a ski trip and are skiing Big Sky and Moonlight, do yourself a favor and take a day or three up to Bridger."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Feb,positive,4,$25 for a lift ticket and 5 dollar rentals. Being old never seemed so good !! :-) leaver your boards at home !! Bridger is to Big Sky as Targhee is to Jackson Hole.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Jan,positive,5,"We had an amazing time at Bridger. They have slopes for all levels and their prices are really affordable. The lines were very manageable with the upper slopes in particular being challenging yet fun. Additionally, the lodge has a ton of amenities and the bar there is the perfect place for apres ski."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Jan,positive,5,"used the marketing dept for a powder hound package what a great deal. cannot get any more service I felt like i was famly as every one could not do enough . every question answered every need met . they just made myself and companions have an ski experience of a lifetime . thank you all marketing , shop staff , lifties ,ski storage and mountian hosts . world class people . The bowl has the steeps and terrain to excite all two boys packed up to the ridge and evry bit of advice they where given and photos made it the adventure of a lifetime .\n\nGreat place"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Jan,positive,5,"We stayed and skiied 4 days over Christmas and New Years. We were blessed with excellent conditions and fantastic skiing. Even during the holidays new lift options kept line very short and there was a nice variety of terrain to explore. Lodge facilites were stupendous and prices reflect the non profit nature. This place is awsome for family skiing and we were entertained each day with the sights of the Ridge Runners desending the chutes and traverses. We very much enjoyed the live music, fireworks and torchlight parade the evening before New Years. The resort is very close to Bozeman...about a fifteen minute drive... but, the curves at the beginning of the canyon deserve respect. Get there early and you are rewarded with premium parking."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Dec,positive,5,"Bridger Bowl, located a mere twenty minutes from Bozeman Montana, is a great ski area. Bridger has eight ski lifts. With these lifts, you can access terrain that works for any level of ability. More often then not, lines are short or non-existent. Rarely, you will have a moderate lift line, usually on powder days. You can ride up Bridger Lift and then hike onto the Ridge of this mountain. Tons of unmarked runs off expert level can be reached off of the Ridge. They range from steep chutes to wide open powder fields. In my opinion, the best part of this local ski area is the vibe it carries. Everyone is friendly and as stoked to be there as you will be. I ski there all the time, and I love every minute I spend on the mountain."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Feb,negative,3,Great terrain for a medium size Mountain. Location is 16 miles from Bozeman so stay in Bozeman and drive!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Mar,negative,3,I work up at Bridger and am always stoked on powder days. Schlushmens lift brings you to some rad steeps and plentiful powder skiing. Love this hometown resort. Don't forget your apres ski/board beer at Jimmy B's.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Apr,positive,5,great skiing at a hill close to Bozeman. Takes only 30 minutes (if that) to drive there. Great snow and runs.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Jan,positive,5,"Great mountain and fine folks. No overnight accommodations, unless you check with Bridger Bowl's central reservations. Those folks will set you in the right direction and they will also book lift tickets, lessons, rentals, even daycare sessions with ski lessons for the little tykes."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Feb,positive,4,"We are so grateful for this local ski hill that serves families and extreme skiers alike. Reasonable prices, brown-bag friendly lodge, and beginner slope make it great for families. An avalanche transceiver and shovel open up endless extreme terrain. FUN!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Feb,positive,4,"Bridger's snow is crappy and so are the people. Go to Showdown, located about 2 hours north near Monarch and Neihart. They have champagne powder and every one has a smiling face. Never a line either. Amazing!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,positive,4,"Bridger Bowl is a gem. Short lines, usually tons of snow, cheap tickets and almost zero commercialization. A non-profit hill that ranks on many top 20 lists. Bozeman is a great place to spend a week (or longer) and is only 16 miles or so from Bridger. What are you waitng for?"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Mar,positive,4,"IN Plato‚Äôs allegory of the cave, the famous philosopher describes humanity as living in an unenlightened cave, blind to the true, epicurean pleasures of life, waiting to be led out of their wretched existence. Wretched is the word I would use to accurately describe East Coast skiing, days of ice and slippery slopes, impossible to find traction or garner thrill from truly challenging slopes. When my parents put me on a plane to Montana with my siblings, I was being led out of my metaphorical cave of tepid and halfhearted downhill. For the first time at Bridger Mountain, I was experiencing truly challenging skiing.\n\nOur arrival at the slopes was shortly accompanied by three feet of powder fall, as the temperature drop to under ten degrees, perfect snow for skiing in. Heaven is the only word for it, heaven with a few numbed extremities. It was almost ethereal. The enjoyment of it was blinding, racing through waist deep powder.\n\nBridger Mountain is also different from other resorts in that it is less of a resort and more of a heavily ski based lodge and slopes. The sheer size of the mountain was amazing. There are nearly three times as many runs as the local slopes in my native Cincinnati, and the large majority are black diamonds, with a hefty section of double-black diamonds too. But if fast is not your style, there are long winding greens and blues to choose from too. Even if I had become bored with those slopes there is still the backwater skiing through the uncharted west side of the mountain through Slashman‚Äôs Canyon and Mundy‚Äôs Bowl, the truly untouched areas.\n\nThe lodge is cozy too, with a well-supplied cafeteria and nearby lodging for those who want to stay on site, but there are also places to stay and eat of the slopes. And if you get tired of skiing altogether there is still Bozeman, a small city thirty away.\n\nFrom the slopes to the service, Bridger Bowl in Montana has truly opened my eyes to the joys of skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Feb,positive,5,Snow was a bit sparse (very unusal for this time of year) but we had great fun and the sunshine made up for the lack of snow!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Mar,positive,5,This is the best place to ski. The lift opp's are super friendly with the little kids. There is plenty of terrain for everyone from the begginger to the advanced. This is a east facing mountain range so it holds its snow extremely well. Rent the proper eq. and find someone to take you to the ridge if you are a good skier. We do the Powder Hound package. This is the best place to take your family for a great ski vacation without taking out a loan...
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Dec,positive,5,"We skied over Xmas 2011 since not enough to open all lift we got tickets for $20! For us, we are beginner/intermediate skiers so the lifts that were open were perfectly fine for us. Plus two beautiful lodges to eat lunch in. What a hidden gem this ski resort is. Not too crowded, no wait on the ski lifts. Would highly recommend."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,positive,5,"Every time I've gone there (about 10 times each year, for the last 7 yrs) the trails are well groomed, they have lots of terrain, and they're adding more, and the people are nice. Why I like them more than Big Ski is because one year I went to Big Sky and the said they had a 72"" base, BUT THEY LIEDüò°!!! I spent the whole day either skiing in slush or on rocks."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Dec,positive,4,"Montana has had little snow this year, but our trip to Bridger Bowl was still a fun day on the slopes. The lines were almost ZERO wait all day long."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Dec,positive,5,"Big Sky is expensive and chi-shi. BB is the place is where the locals like to ski. Prices are fair and the place is owned by the taxpayers, not some fancy California corporation. Located in a scenic valley much closer to the downtown and airport."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Nov,positive,4,"great place, very extremely challenging. always has snow, great town, and lodging, great food, pubs, whatever you need. only 16 miles up the canyon rd"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,20-Feb,positive,4,"This is rated as one of the best skiing experiences anywhere by more than one magazine‚Äî&amp; many people ‚Äúin the know‚Äù! It‚Äôs BEAUTIFUL! Shuttles are available from Bozeman, which make it very convenient because parking is quite limited, by design.\n\nIn summer months, this is a beautiful area to drive &amp; hike, too‚Äîjust be sure to wear good hiking shoes &amp; always carry plenty of water &amp; BEAR SPRAY."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,20-Jan,positive,4,"It's hard to beat the combo of great skiing, less than hour from Bozeman, laid back atmosphere and great pricing. From extreme to beginner, you will find what you want. Plus, they have had many updates to lifts in recent years. I almost hate to write this review because I love no lift lines."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,20-Mar,positive,5,"I love BB! Easy to get there, convenient parking and set up. Pricing was what I expected - around $100 for ticket &amp; gear for the day. Very efficient getting outfitted with equipment. I didn't wait on a lift the entire day - ski up and get on. I know my limits and stay on the easy to intermediate runs and there were plenty. Great variety and no surprises. Lunch was reasonable and efficient. All around great day."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,20-Feb,positive,5,"Bridgers 1st Steeps Clinic was awesome. The Ski School set these clinics up perfectly with the Steeps first, then Intro to Ridge, to Ridge tactics. Bridger is my favorite place because it‚Äôs like my home hill, only longer, and steeper. I plan on going back next year, maybe twice for the Ridge. Th@nks Joe and Crew!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,20-Feb,positive,4,"Hit this mountain on a powder day, a Friday. Had a great day, staff was friendly, mountain has tons of variety, they were quite busy but lines were very manageable. Will certainly ski here again"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,20-Jan,positive,5,"I'm not much of snow boarder (nor ski person), however, it was the best one I ever visited.\nComing from Los Angeles, I've been Bigbear, Mammoth, Charleston in Vegas, and a few smaller places. \nThis place is definately better. \nWe stopped by on the way to Yellowstone North gate as we had couple extra days. Loved it, so returned after Yellowstone visit.\nIt has several bigining courses for my boys and biginning/intermediate course which was not too scary for beginner but long enough to enjoy the ride.\nWe even thought about flying from Los Angeles in future just for the snowboard/ski.\n"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,20-Jan,positive,5,"My husband and I bought a midweek ski package from Bridger Bowl. This included skiing at Bridger and staying at the Element in downtown Bozeman. We loved both experiences and highly recommend this package! Fern Corwin from Bridger coordinated the details. She was so kind and easy to contact and we even got to meet her in person when we were at Bridger. If you can get away for midweek skiing this is the BEST- no crowds, no lift lines, and lunch at Alpine cabin mid mountain.\nThe Element has a lobby breakfast that is beautiful and bountiful and also a relaxing happy hour . We plan to return next winter."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Dec,positive,5,"Nice drive from Bozeman. Our 1st trip here for Family ski trip with adults, teens &amp; small kids, this was perfect for all. Really liked the kids fenced area to warm up or learn to ski with small lift, this is nice. The staff at all of the lifts were great &amp; kind. Great runs for all the family from black to beginner. Decent price for lifts, thank you. The only problem we had was finding a seat at lunch, all lodges were very full. We will definitely ski here again!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Dec,positive,5,"Someone we know recommended Bridger Bowl because it had good skiing and it was economical (if that word can be used when taking a family skiing) compared to other resorts in the Rockies. We spent 10 days in Bozeman through Christmas and had a great time. The skiing is really good and is a bit of a hidden gem as long as you have not been spoiled by some of the resorts that offer high speed, heated lifts and ski in/out villages at the bottom of the mountain. We've enjoyed those amenities also but going this time of year also impacts the cost of lift tickets quite a bit. We paid $65 which was $100 less/ticket than Big Sky. Big Sky is 50 miles south of Bozeman, it offers all the things you can imagine in a ski resort and you will pay dearly for everything. Bridger Bowl is a no frills mountain. It does have one small cafe 1/2 way down one of the runs and a couple of places at the bottom of the mountain to get grilled food. There Is no logging on the mountain. You drive in each day or there's a bus that runs from Bozeman which is about 20 minutes away. You'll need something other than an American Express to pay because they don't accept that card. In spite of the sparce accommodations we really enjoyed ourselves. The skiing is great and the runs were not crowded at all. I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try as long as you're good with simple and not looking for the total resort experience. You'll definitely save some money."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Dec,negative,3,The hill is very heavily used and ridden that it was ruts/ice from people‚Äôs boards. Biggest problem is they need more snow (not their fault). Lots of very nice people to talk to. The lodge and bar were completed packed and it was hard to find anywhere to sit. Overall a good day.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Jan,positive,4,"Bridger Bowl is an amazing ski area, great runs, close to Bozeman and reasonable prices. Beautiful setting and easy access. Definitely a must ski area!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Jan,positive,4,"The signage to get to the ski rental place was confusing, but once we were there we foudn excellent customer service. The slopes were beautiful -- we stayed on the Alpine hill since we are beginnners, and we had a great day!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,5,"Bridger Bowl is a great place to ski and ride. Wide variety of terrain to satisfy any skill level. Laid back, friendly attitude. A very well kept local secret, weekdays almost never have lift lines."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Dec,positive,5,Our son loves this place. He goes every chance he gets. They do schooling events that the kids cant wait for that is all they talk about.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Dec,positive,4,A great steep mountain. Usually over looked by big sky but no ones sad about that. Very local spot!!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,positive,5,"Great skiing, has something for everyone. Good runs. Nice friendly staff. Much smaller than Big Sky and less expensive. Nice in the summer too for day hikes."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,5,"Bozeman, has some great skiing. I have 2 girls (10 and 7 ) and thought they'd love to learn to ski during a work trip one year. So we went to Big Sky during spring break. If you've been there, it's amazing! the kids got comfortable and there were not a lot of folks around. Fast forward 1 year, another work trip and I decided to bring the family up too. Big Sky, for it's amazingness, is pretty $$$$. We decided to try Bridger at the behest of the locals. My girls, being girls, freaked out at the lack of familiarity for their 2nd time skiing. I assure you, once they were done, the reviews of Bridger were all 5 star for them. Loved the mountain, the staff was so nice and wonderful and helpful. to me, that's what important. It didn't break the bank, it was good skiing, and my family felt warm and welcome. We'll ski there anytime. Very worth a visit"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Dec,positive,4,"Great place for skiers of all ages and abilities. I've been skiing here for 32 years, started in college and raised my kids on these slopes. We have skied plenty at Big Sky and Moonlight, but we always come back to Bridger. It's our hometown hill -- lots of variety in the terrain and technical difficulty, plenty of vertical thrills, good prices and great food. Don't miss the fries!! The ski school is top notch and it is just so friendly and convenient."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Sep,positive,4,I grew up and learned to ski at Bridger. Although it has changed a lot since I was a kid I still like Bridger over Big Sky or any other ski hill in the area. The skiing is fantastic and they have made many improvements in the past 10 years to make the skiing even better. I have been to a few weddings at the Jim Bridger and one at the Deer Park Chalet and those are stunning! I love Bridger and I always will!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,negative,3,"There is plenety of sking for all skill levels here and low to no waiting in lines, even weekends. The ski tickets are quite reasonable. This is a nice place to take a break from the crowds and enjoy a place the locals call home. Ski scools are top notch and are kept small."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,21-Dec,positive,4,"Once Again Bridger Bowl Skiing was a total blast. John Saams - awesome ski instructor crushed it. We worked with him twice a day for 5 days two years ago, and last week he was terrific as well. Anyone wanting a great ski experience should reach out to Bridger Bowl in Bozeman for ski lessons and wonderful skiing for all levels. Even great skiers would enjoy this local resort. \n\nA shout out to the women in the Ski School office. Peggy, Jennifer &amp; Shannon are fantastic.\n\nJohn Saams - The King of all that's skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,22-Jan,negative,2,"Took family on 2 seperate days during a vacation to ski at Bridger Bowl- the first day was wonderful-rented from Bridger Bowl-had great equipment and experience but on the next visit-had to rent from Roadhouse Sports-just across parking lot from Bridger Bowl- equipment was faulty and put my kids life at risk- when one child had to walk down mountain because board too small-she returned to rental place- the girl who rented said ""OH I KNEW YOU WOULDNT BE ABLE TO STAY UP BUT OH WELL"" and my other daughters skis would not stay locked to boot appropriately--after 2 rescues from ski partrol- they noted the defective skis and apologized but said it was a bad rental place-both girls never skiied that day and left in tears- WOULD NEVER RENT FROM THEM-they knowingly put MY DAUGHTERS LIFE AT RISK for a rental fee!!!!!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,21-Dec,positive,5,"Lots of long runs, variety and different levels of difficulty. Helpful and friendly staff. Torchlight parade and fireworks were extra special. Food is expensive so bring your own lunch/snacks."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,21-Dec,positive,5,"Family skiing after Christmas Day! So lovely! Nice powder, groomed runs and a fun grill with local brews at the end of a perfect day!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,21-Dec,positive,4,"Purchased all day ski passes online in advance. In theory this should‚Äôve saved time upon arrival. This was the biggest downside of our day at Bridger Bowl. We waited for close to 2 hours to get the passes and rent equipment. Now for the praise: one of our sons got sick after I paid for his equipment and pass. I visited the ski services area and spoke to a manager who transferred his day pass and equipment rental to a different day. The staff also helped us after learning my husband was in a car wreck on his way to pick up two of us, and our shoes were in the damaged vehicle! They found us some lost and found shoes so we didn‚Äôt have to wear socks off property that night. My son and I took the bus service from the ski area to the Bozeman fair grounds and got an Uber from there back to our hotel in Bozeman. Beautiful ski area for all ski levels."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,21-Mar,positive,5,"I've never been skiing before. I booked a snowboard lesson for the morning on a Saturday in March. The instructors were great and there were only 3 people in my group so it was easy to learn the basics. Wish we had more time going down the slopes with the instructors. We basically got 2 turns each, but I understand most of the lesson was learning how to move the board. I would come again. Also, the process with booking reservations online and everything being done with covid procedures went smoothly."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,21-Apr,positive,4,"Out of 4 of us, I‚Äôm the skier who sticks to greens because I‚Äôm anxious.\nThis was my idea of a perfect day of skiing. The worst part was the very end by the lifts. Very chill, beautiful views everywhere. My kids and husband had a great day on other runs. 11 yo said ‚Äúbest day skiing ever‚Äù he‚Äôs been to Breckinridge 3 times, and park city - so I‚Äôd say high praise.\nI‚Äôd love to come here again."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,21-Feb,positive,5,"Snow was amazing, views were amazing, staff was amazing. Simply one of the best ski areas in the U.S. for experienced skiers who like to hang out with, and be around, other skiers. But also very family friendly. Saw as many young families as I saw hard core skiers going off the edge."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,21-Jan,positive,5,"This was our first time skiing here and it was great. Tons of wide well groomed runs which was nice. Not a lot of people due to covid pre purchase requirements. Not a ton of moguls and what was there was very manageable. My 46 year old legs don‚Äôt appreciate moguls anymore, and most of the resort is groomed so it was enjoyable. To be honest the coverage was a little sparse, but not much the resort can do about that. The drive to the resort was super easy. No scary mountain road drive at all. Good parking and excellent amenities. We didn‚Äôt go up to the top of the ridge at all, but if you are looking for some steep drops and shoots they have it. Adult ticket was $65 I think and my 15 year old was only $40. Excellent experience."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,20-Dec,positive,4,"I grew up skiing on this hill, so it's a special place for me. Usually smaller crowds and certainly cheaper prices than nearby Big Sky. The terrain can be quite challenging if you're prepared to look for it. The only reason I marked a four star was because I went early in the year before enough snow had accumulated and the slopes were a bit ""gravelly"". It will pick up soon and be great skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,positive,5,"Compared to some of the other ski hills around the area this place is a heck of a deal! Awesome skiing, more of a skiers hill than snowboarders but either way you will have a good time for a great price!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Dec,positive,5,"We love to ski Bridger Bowl. That is why we come back every year. Awesome family ski hill, lift tickets are a fair price, friendly, well run resort."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Dec,positive,5,Skip the lines and high prices at Big Sky and enjoy the local flare at Bridger Bowl. I haven't been in 10 years and they have made some wonderful improvements to the chair lifts! I had the best day last week. The ski rentals at the slope were affordable and the staff friendly and knowledgeable. I can't wait to go back to this hidden gem!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,positive,5,"We 've been coming here on and off for about 10 years. We drive all the way from Chicago for week or 10 days of fun on a slopes. We ski here during Christmas/ New Year break and during spring break and both times are great for skiing. Big area and not too many people, a lot of runs for beginners and intermediate. Top part of bowl is too difficult for me. Prices are lower than any ski area around Chicago and half of price of Big Sky. Very friendly staff, great prices for ski lessons."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Dec,positive,4,"We skied Bridger Bowl twice while staying at Big Sky because the weather was not cooperating with producing snow cover. While we were skiing over rocks at Big Sky, Bridger Bowl was almost completely open with about the same snow cover. The staff was very friendly and the early season rates were very good. There is a good variety of terrain to choose from and no crowds. Bridger Bowl is an easy drive from Bozeman which allows for more of a variety of lodging to choose from. The view from the summit is beautiful also."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Jan,negative,3,"This is a local ski slope just outside of Bozeman. Big Sky is 1.5 hours away, but Bridger is 20 minutes. The lift tickets are very reasonable and the place is not crowded. I didn't feel cheated by a half day of skiing because the prices are low."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Oct,positive,5,"This is within easy driving distance of Bozeman, and the steep trails up to the ridge offer spectacular views over the local landscape. Highly worth a visit for a short hike that can either be strenuous, or you can follow the trails for an easy walk"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Sep,positive,4,"Service was great but game food on a pizza? Just was not for me. Growler? I'm a city slicker---never heard of one. Saw people carrying this ""jug"" around and ask what is this. Then I bought one!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Aug,positive,5,The drive up to the Bridger mountains is so scenic! There are many hiking trails - with all different skill levels. It is a very family-friendly area. Great place for a wedding reception.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Jan,positive,5,"We love Bridger Bowl. It is a great local ski area. The lift ticket prices are very reasonable. And, the restaurant that is on site is very good. We had a burger and a local brew for lunch."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Feb,positive,4,"Close to Bozeman, good slopes, made it perfect for skiing during school. The price of the tickets were reasonable. Parking was ok."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Sep,positive,5,"my husband and I travel every year on a road trip the ski resorts to see where we want to go in the winter. Although the resort is closed now, the views getting there were stunning and the mountain looks great for a good local vibe. nothing fancy just good skiing"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Feb,positive,5,We've had season passes here for years but the day rates are the most reasonable around. Family oriented and a great value. Views from the top of Alpine lift are spectacular! Love Bridger Bowl!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Mar,positive,5,"Bridge, which is co-owned by the city and University, offers a superb, friendly, and challenging opportunity away from the crowds, hustle, and glamor of the big resorts. The staff is the most important feature, and here they shine...and the food is both delicious and modestly priced. The National Ski Patrol trains here yearly on mountain rescue, and the steeps at the peaks are most challenging...give it a try, and you will be ;changed for life"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Mar,positive,5,"Live in Bozeman and have skied at Bridger Bowl for the last 24 years. Excellent terrain for all levels of skiing. Generally uncrowded during the week, with the exception of the week between Christmas and New Years and the week of Presidents' Day. Perfect for those who like a friendly atmosphere and friendly people."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Jan,positive,5,"Love the meadows. They will be getting a new chair lift taking you over to the meadows. Foods okay, bar is good."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Dec,negative,3,I love Bridget so much it is awesome the only thing I dislike mildly is lift speed and I know that is hard to change but if you can please Bridger speed up the lifts to make the last run of the day
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Feb,negative,3,This is our local hill. It has a lot of difficult terrain with a reasonable amount of easier stuff. Snow is usually pretty good.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Dec,positive,4,"This place used to be a local, amazing, very inexpensive gem. One of the best ski areas I've ever been to. Then either they discovered they could get more $$, Bozeman got too big, people discovered it or whatever, the place is now crowded and expensive. Not as expensive as Big Sky or Teton Village, but those are a billionaire/politician freak shows. Too bad, this place was a gem."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,positive,4,"Close to Bozeman, MT and a frequent destination for the locals. The kids love it for snowboarding. A great place for children to learn how to ski."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,positive,4,"Everything was good, except my skiing abilities! Pricier than Great Divide, but everything was nicer too. My kids took skiing lessons there and that was very helpful for them being first time skiiers."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Mar,positive,5,"In Alberta there is nothing close to this place. No rocks even though it was late in the year. The snow is soft, not like the man made stuff back home. Not for the novice, a lot of excellent expert runs. We in particular liked renting the avalanche transceivers and skied the back side lift. We did encounter a few sheer cliffs and one avalanche that went through a back run earlier, not for the feint of heart!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Mar,positive,4,"Best value in skiing.\nWorld-class mountain with thoughtful, friendly, helpful staff.\nDo not come if you're looking for a resort experience.\nCome if you love skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Feb,positive,5,"Visited Bridger Bowl with the intention of taking snowboard lessons during my stay in Bozeman--what a great decision! The prices make skiing/snowboarding accessible even to those on limited budgets, the staff is top-notch, and the lack of lift lines make for an enjoyable on the slopes instead of waiting at the base. There is a variety of terrain and seems to suit all levels from novices up to backcountry skiiers. I worked with Chip, Joe, and Jaime who were all excellent instructors and helped me form a great base of skills and develop confidence in my first few days riding... be warned though, I had such a great experience and developed such a love of winter sports at Bridger that I ended up seeking ski resort employment nearby so I could keep improving on my skills!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Jan,negative,2,"For a ski hill its prett lame, especially for montana. There are so many mountains and so much snow. you would think someone would build something to top this"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Jan,negative,3,"I've skied Bridger a handful of times over the last 15 years and am never disappointed. Short lift lines, great terrain for all levels of skiers and friendly people. Always love skiing the Cold Smoke. If your in Bozeman set off to ski Big Sky, don't turn your nose up at Bridger. You won't be disappointed and you can't beat the value anywhere."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,positive,5,"Amazing skiing, amazing view! Thanks to Bridger Bowl for such a great experience! The prices were reasonable, terrain well groomed, all facilities were great. Can't wait to go back."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Feb,positive,5,"If you are a traveler that needs some hand holding, likes to have a perfectly served hot meal or needs the bus to pick you up when you park 100 yards away, then please go to Big Sky. It's not far. You'll like it better, and I'll like it better. \n\nIf you're looking to go skiing for the snow - please keep reading. To get a feel for Bridger please consider my favorite North American ski areas... Of course Bridger, but also Loveland, Taos (Thank you Ernie), Alta, A Basin... Real skiers (ie - people who really want to ski), steeps to ski, pow that lasts longer than one day, good french fries, and excellent draft beer. I'm not worried about shinny handles, glitzy chairs or the carpeting (although I didn't see any that was frayed). I'm looking for good snow and a safe environment for my kids. And yes, safe can be knowing they're on the Ridge with a beacon and a pack! Why? Because they're surrounded by beacons (more than I've seen at any resort), experience, volunteers, and just simply... a ton genuinely nice people.\n\nMy thanx to everyone on mountain. You're wonderfully professional and fun. Special thanx to Emily and Wanda in Group. You set us up. See everyone later this Spring and again next year with a bigger group!!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Dec,positive,4,Our family enjoyed their day at Bridger Bowl. The price was very good and no crowds. The lodge was comfortable and tables to eat our packed lunch.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Feb,positive,4,My son is considering Montana State University for college. Having this amazing ski area within 30 minutes from Bozeman is quite enticing. MSU students often have mid-week passes with free transportation and few crowds.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Dec,negative,1,"My friend was visiting from Germany. I wanted to show her around Montana. She has never skied before. I went to college at MSU, and recall great experiences and $30 lift ticket prices.\n\nI was excited to give her a great Montana experience. We arrived for half day skiing, purchased our tickets, and got geared up. When we got to the lift line, the power went out and all skiing was closed. Although it is not likely that the power outage was their fault, their subsequent behavior was appalling. I asked for a refund of the ticket as we were completely unable to use the tickets at all. The ticket office people were rude and condescending when approaching them about a refund. I called the office a couple days later to ask if we could return to attempt another visit using our already purchased tickets. Again, the ticket office staff were rude and condescending. Basically elitist pricks. They made it sound like I didn‚Äôt belong in Bozeman where everyone apparently has excessive amounts of money to throw around. They made it sound like it was my fault for their power outage. The person on the phone stated that it was my fault ‚Äúfor not arriving earlier in the day‚Äù. Unfortunately our itinerary only allowed for a late half day visit. \n\nNot only have they refused to honor our unused tickets but they made themselves sound like rootless cosmopolitans who are too elitist for your average Montanan. \n\nI recommend avoiding this place. Bridger operates on public land leased to them but they don‚Äôt act like they respect their privilege to do so.\n\nSave your money and invest in randonee gear and explore the mountains on your own."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Dec,positive,4,"When we drove to Bridger from our home in Helena recently, the good experience began in the parking lot. There's a special, close-in, lot reserved for handicap folks and anyone who caarpools (minimum three occupants per vehicle). Excellent! We also saw a city of Bozeman bus taking people to the ski hill. \n\nThe two main lodges are really well designed and maintained. Nice, but not overstated or glitzy. Very clean. \n\nRental shop opened early (!) and the rental experience was very smooth, professional,helpful and efficient. The snowboard, boots and helmet our son rented were new, in excellent condition and of high quality. Ticket window also opened early (!) and the salesclerk was cordial. Ticket price is higher than at our local ski hill back in Helena (Great Divide), but frankly it was worth it. Of course, the $63 lift ticket price at Bridger is far less than the absolutely crazy $154 we would have paid at Big Sky (otherwise known as Big Wallet). \n\nEvery Bridger employee we encountered was courteous and professional. The vibe everywhere was down to earth, pleasant and upbeat. At no time did we encounter rude or pushy people. \n\nThe lifts were good. One odd thing, however. On at least two lifts, they use a weird kind of ""magic carpet"" to move you up to where you get on the chair. We didn't like it, but it wasn't a big deal. But otherwise, the lifts moved along quickly and the lifties were great (they'd call out to us ""What's your favorite Christmas movie?""). \n\nRuns were superb. The green runs were gentle, but varied, and provided relaxed cruising. Blue runs were great fun: challenging enough, but not overdone. Other family members raved about black diamond and double black runs. Grooming was excellent. The variety of skiing/snowboarding terrain was superb. Views (of the Crazy, Gallatin, Bridger and Absaroka ranges) were world-class. Even on a Saturday during Christmas Break, we never experienced crowding on the runs, or long lines at the lifts. Wow. \n\nNever saw a ski patroller on the runs. But then again, had no problems with other skiers/riders, and saw no accidents. \n\nOn the particular day we were there, the afternoon experienced some very high winds. So watch the weather forecast and realize that (at times) high winds can be an issue.\n\nIf I ran Bridger, I would add more signs on the runs. At times, we had to stop and refer to our map to figure out where we were. \n\nWe ate in the cafeteria in the upper lodge. Wish that some people didn't leave their bags lying around. But otherwise, it was a pleasant eating space. Food was better than most ski area cafeterias and somewhat less greasy and fatty (my wife had minnestrone soup and bread) and not as expensive as typical ski area food. \n\nWhen we packed up and left for the day, we all had smiles on our faces. We'll be back."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Dec,negative,3,"Went in 1999 and they improved a lot. More things for skiing. New place for beginners separate from the experience skiers. You can bring your dogs, too. Have snow making machines. Ready anytime in winter."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Feb,negative,3,"We had the mountain to ourselves on a recent COLD February morning. While the lodge leaves you feeling that it is lacking, the skiing is top notch!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Feb,negative,2,Even though the tickets are affordable the crowds have really increased and the kids ski very fast and out of controll\nThere isn't much supervision controlling speed and drinking on the mountain by the skipatrol or the mountain staff.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Nov,negative,3,"For those of whom don't ski they may sit inside, enjoy hot coffee, cocoa and gaze out the huge windows to watch the beauty of dancing slopes of the Bridger Mt's. There are also low-cost lessons for all levels w/ lockers to place all items. It's good to arrive early so you may find a free place to park or take the free shuttle to the slopes. For skiers think cold w/ proper layers of clothing. If one loses their hat, gloves they have lost &amp; found. Enjoy all w/ camera. Great 1st aid station."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Jan,positive,4,"We just moved to Bozeman this year. My boys took ski lessons here &amp; we (parents) skied here this winter. Great skiing/snow, usually the lines are not bad at all. Reasonably priced &amp; short distance to get there (from Bozeman). Only a couple ""negative"" things: some Saturdays the road up to Bridger is ridiculous! It took us 1.5 hours to get like 10 miles b/c there were so many cars going up there &amp; some were NOT winter ready, so going off the road, spinning out, etc. It was a mess! The MSU students all go here &amp; again, that makes it a bit more crowded on weekends on the road, not to mention sometimes a little ""rowdy"" on the slopes w/ college kids (drinking, being a bit ""wild"" etc.). Honestly, not a big deal, but my boys commented on that aspect at least a couple times. Otherwise, great place to ski! Lots of terrain &amp; plenty of different levels of runs."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Apr,positive,5,Spent 2 days skiing at Bridger Bowl with 11 and 13 year old kids. Great time. Wasn‚Äôt busy at all so no lines at the lifts. Plenty of snow - conditions were great. Very affordable lift and rental prices made for an enjoyable couple days. We‚Äôll be back.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Dec,positive,4,"I like Bridger, it is the low key and less expensive alternative to the resorts at Big Sky. There were no waits for the lifts, and the ski school was great for my 8 year old niece. We are so glad we chose to ski at Bridger over Big Sky. Bridger is a better option for families and new skiers."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Mar,positive,4,We are seasoned Big Sky skiers but in recent years have found the prices there to be astronomical and just out of our budget for a family. For 4 people to ski there with 2 kids it costs over $400. Bridger is a GREAT ski area with lots of varied terrain for beginners and experts alike. Every lift is a carpet loader system which is really helpful for beginners. For this level of area I would expect higher rates so this is a rocking deal. $22 for my kids to ski is just so amazing. It's 20ish minutes from town too. Just a note though on busy days get there EARLY or you will be huffing it uphill for a while. There is no shuttle service from the parking lots so once the lots fill up that's it. There is a shuttle from town that I would recommend. It drops you off at the lodge so no walking or worrying about if you're going to get a parking spot. The lodges are really very nice - we usually eat at the mid-mtn one - newly built and a lot of options for food. We love sitting out on the deck if the weather allows and people watching. You really don't want to miss this ski area. Thank you Bridger for keeping your area affordable for the masses. We will be back many times.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,positive,5,Bridger Bowl while a local hill is a great place to ski with varied terrain including some very challenging skiing that is accessible by hiking the ride.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Jan,positive,4,No cell tower!!! Streamline bus runs shuttle or hitch hike.Locals and college types love this place. I do not ski.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Feb,positive,4,Been there many times. It has runs from beginner to expert. It is huge and a lot of fun. Can't go wrong here. It's an easy drive from Bozeman and only two hours from Billings.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Feb,positive,4,"You cannot beat this place for value, 1/2 the price of Big Sky and zero pretentiousness, a great family area and close to town."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,positive,5,"This is a mountain for every skier. The lower areas are very open and gentle for beginners, middle for intermediates, and all the way to the top of the ridge for true experts. Multiple lifts around open up area so you can ski lots of different runs and levels of terrain. The lodges are all really new and comfortable, fast, easy loading chairs. You load onto the chairs on a magic carpet conveyer belt. Close to Bozeman, 16 miles, so easy trip back when done. A shuttle bus runs from town for free too, so no need to park and carry gear. Tickets are reasonably priced, can book a package through the website and save on the room and tickets and discounted food tickets. They really make it easy and worthwhile to go. Will go back for more!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,negative,3,"We had spring skiing conditions and a need for some WAX. No crowds, friendly atmo. Potential for some epic powder skiing above the in area lifts - need avy gear. Price is right, compared to Big Sky"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,negative,3,My first visit to Bridger Bowl yielded a fantastic Spring Day. I enjoyed the terrain. Next time I'll be prepared to hike the Ridge.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,positive,4,"First time mountain skiing and this location was wonderful. I took advantage of the group lessons (took 3), and two of the days ended up being private lessons because I was the only one in the group. The instructors are amazing, helpful, and fun. The hills have a lot of good variety for all levels, and it isn't so busy that you feel like you will never get on the lift. The people that work there are amazing, and so fun and happy everyday. They sing and dance at the lift, and make you feel like they want to be there. Definitely recommend this ski area."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Feb,positive,5,Local here in Montana and Bridger is by far the best resort in the area! Lots of runs for all levels! Had a blast coming here with my family. Definitely a must for both locals and tourists!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Feb,negative,3,"We are coming every year here for our family week long ski trip. This is not a huge resort, but there are enough trails for a week, with various levels. The prices are very reasonable, which is important for a family of 4 adults! We rent our skis from the lodge, book our hotel with the reservation center, and all the staff is extremely nice and friendly. Thanks Travis for always helping us! We love Bridger and will come back every year until we can ski for free at 80, right?"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Dec,positive,4,I really like this ski resort. Prices are reasonable compared to the size of the mountain they are offering. they have plenty of green and blue routes to offer. it appears to me that the split of routes between green blue and black diamond are equally distributed. I would certainly recommend to any winter sport lovers to come and spend a week here.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Feb,positive,5,This place rocks. I wish all the out of staters would stay in Big Sky as this needs to stay small and locals only!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,positive,5,Love this place! The snow is great and so is the location. I love being able to drive from Bozeman!!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,positive,5,"Bridger received so much snow! Great place to ski ~ Several places to take a break, and get a beer or hot chocolate. Wait times are short!! Just go!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Feb,positive,4,"This is a non-profit ski resort!! The skiing is as good as any mountain that I have skied in MT, CO, UT, NV or CA, and at less than half of cost of most. You can afford to bring the whole family. All of the proceeds go back into expansion and improvements. Are yup looking for extreme? The Ridge and Schlushman's are exceptional. If you want challenging blacks, Bridger has them. Do you prefer the groomers or training terrain? There is that in abundance too."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,negative,3,"Travelled with my daughter on a spring break trip. Snow and terrain were awesome. We have been coming here for years as a family, best ski area for the money."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,negative,3,"The ski area is getting to be much more crowded than it used to be, but is still my top choice in the Bozeman/Big Sky area for a weekday ski. There is a lunch cafeteria at the base and also one on the mountain by the bridger lift with some homemade food options."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,positive,4,"We were impressed with this resort, not only were the rates affordable, but a ton of terrain to choose from!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Feb,positive,4,"Where I come from... we measure 26 in centimeters... not inches... 26 cm at Revelstoke means get in line at like 6:00 AM. What do you do when it snows 26"" overnight? I still don't know how to comprehend that day....\n\nShout out to Ski patrol who somehow got the whole mountain open at some point in the day. Like.... WOW. AMAZING. \n\nShout out to the locals who were super friendly and in amazing spirits. No one was stealing lines and people were happy to show a fellow powder hound a good time. \n\nShout out to all the lifties and ticket attendants who made the obscene lift lines not matter that much.\n\nKnow this Bridger Bowl... I will be back as I want to test out that crazy looking ridge terrain on a regular old day. I was lucky to get an OBSCENE powder day (the BBC as the locals informed me...) and it was a blast. Your terrain is amazing and up there with the likes of Jackson, Whistler, Snowbird, and my little hometown mountain Revelstoke!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,negative,3,"Bridger Bowl is a wonderful local ski area with reasonable rates for skiing and very competent people working in all phases of resort operation. The ski patrol is first class. The snow can be a little variable from year to year, but when it's good it's really good. Unfortunately, it has become too popular so weekends can be a total zoo."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Feb,negative,3,Bridger Bowl is a great local ski area. It is not crowded on the week days unless it's a holiday. Great runs for all levels of skiing.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Feb,negative,3,"Just 20 minutes from beautiful Bozeman, Montana, Bridger is the perfect area to take the family to ski! No long lines, great instructors, amazing conditions. You cannot beat Bridger for best Return on Vacation Investment!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Feb,positive,4,I've been here already two seasons. So one thing that I love about Bridgers is not so many people on regular days. One thing I don't like are slow lifts. Food in all lodges is great. So overall it is nice ski resort. And it doesn't matter if you're skiing alone or with family. Thumbs up Bridgers! \nP.S: but those lifts though...
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Jan,positive,5,"This is a truly special ski area. Bridger Bowl is where little kids from Bozeman learn to ski really well, it is a rite of passage for most. A great first time ski vacation for a middle class family. Not a huge dog and pony show full of pomp and jackasses who have flown in from LA with all the best gear they will never use again and an Escalade they can't get into 4 wheel drive. Only a 20 minute drive to a great downtown with excellent restaurants. A family mountain with great ski terrain and local friendlies that will help you get you, your roommates and dependents organized for an epic skiing adventure."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Jan,positive,5,"You cannot beat the ticket prices for this place! $57/lift ticket (non-holiday) Skiing is great. Would love to see more blue runs but I think they were limited partly because we went while early ski conditions existed (not as much snow yet). Customer Service is what gave this place my Excellent Rating. They are fantastic! Felt like friends by the time we were done, especially James in the ski shop."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Jan,positive,4,"Came back to Bridger Bowl after going to other Montana places for the last 6 years. The upgrades to the north side of the mountain with the 2 lifts and the new lodge was very nice. Free wifi at the alpine lodge was a nice surprise after finding out there is no cell service once you leave Bozeman. Was there during the nfl playoffs so wanted to watch some of the games and needed wifi as there are no tvs that I could find on the mountain. The lines were small, no wait was more than 3 minutes and the loading carpet helped but every lift stopped at least once when riding so guessing there was falling on the unload. Glad I went back, really like it here and will come back again soon."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Dec,positive,5,"This ski area is by far one of the best around. It is not nearly as big as Big Sky but this is the place that all the locals hang out. Lift tickets are cheap and usually they are always 100% open all winter. Very impressed with how the ski area invests back into the mountain, in the last couple years they have upgraded numerous lifts and eating areas. That to me is one of the greatest things a ski area can do, the nicer the lifts are the shorter the lines and I can ski more and be less stressed!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,5,"Our large group has rented a condo close to Bridger Bowl a few years in a row now, and we love the place more every time we come back. Great skiing at affordable prices, and something for all levels of expertise. Get a tour of Bridger Bowl on your first day; it's a great way to learn the mountain, runs and lifts by someone that knows them well! (And remember to tip- these are usually volunteers on the mountain doing this). I appreciate the 2 bathrooms/ cafeterias located away from the lodge- you are never too far from food, or a restroom, should you need it. If you get lucky, you'll get some Blue Smoke powder- one of my best days on a mountain, ever!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Jan,positive,5,We came to Bozeman to ski Big Sky and after a cold and expensive day there decided to give Bridger Bowl a try. What a little gem this is and we would consider going back. Living where we do we have amazing ski resorts in our backyard but this hill really surprised us. A great family feel to it and very little wait times for the lifts. Plus the lift tickets are half as much as Big Sky.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Jan,positive,5,"It's everything you need in a ski resort, without the high prices or the long with lines. They have the double black diamond runs, or they have the basic greens. It's excellent family skiing, and rarely do you see a lift line. And the best part, lift tickets are half the price of other local big resorts."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Aug,positive,4,Climbed a mountain! Summer 2013. A beautiful and great experience. Walking through snow in late July in our sneakers and shorts at 90 something degrees. What a view at the top of Sacajawea!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Dec,positive,4,"This is a wonderful ski resort-low key and family oriented- that also has great powder skiing especially if you take time to hike the ridge. If not-lovely groomed hills, nice places to stop and eat, good parking without a long walk with skis. Never a wait in line to get on the lifts!! Good people-great experience. And rentals are at a great price!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jan,positive,4,"Not much better skiing than at Bridger Bowl. For locals such as myself it is affordable and fun for a day trip. Great snow and grooming where needed. Now don't show this review to anyone, it keeps the crowds away."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jun,positive,5,Not overpriced and fun place to ski. Good BEER and good old Montana ladies. Nice lodge and and love the midway lodge.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jun,positive,5,"Great place, lots of friendly locals. Nice staff and great service. Would ski here over Big Sky any day."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Dec,positive,4,"Great for a smaller, local ski hill. I prefer Big Sky, but you'll have to shell out a few more to ski there."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Mar,positive,4,"Before moving to Montana, I didn't know ski resorts like this existed. Less than 30 minutes from downtown Bozeman, no lines for lifts (ok, sometimes on the busiest of days I have to wait 5 minutes or so), $55 lift tickets, great lessons, rentals and snow conditions. There is skiing for all levels including a bunny slope for beginners and the Ridge which requires an avalanche transceiver. Enjoy great food and sometimes live music, but always drinks after a day skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Mar,negative,3,"Bridger is a great mountain that is only about a 15-20 minute drive from downtown Bozeman. Most people probably visit Bozeman from out of state to ski nearby Big Sky Resort, but that's fine with us."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Apr,negative,3,"Bridger Bowl is only 16 miles from Bozeman making it a playground for winter sports enthusiasts in the area. Excellent expert terrain, less expensive than many ski areas, inexpensive season passes, all lifts have moving carpets for smooth loading. Been skiing/snowboarding there for nearly 30 years now."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jan,positive,4,"Because of Bridger's 2700 ft of vertical, 350+ inches of snow, 2,000 skiable acres and 75 named trails, Bridger is comparable to some of world's best ski resorts. However, due to its renegade nonprofit status and lack of stockholders, Bridger Bowl has been able to eschew typical resort sprawl and reinvest year-end profits back into the mountain for the past half century. The result? Heavenly skiing without the lift lines. One note of caution, there is sometimes a lack of seating in the lodges due to the popularity of Bridger's fries and generous pours of Montucky. Additionally, there are certain areas of the mountain that require an avalanche transceiver to ski - just don't complain about it like the guy in the local favorite YouTube video ""Bridger Bowl Rant"" did, or you will wind up as the opener for all future ski movie premiers."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,negative,3,Our first time to Bridger and really enjoyed it. Affordable skiing and a nice variety of terrain. Blessed with fresh snow so had lots of powder to play in but also nice groomers. Staff is friendly too.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,4,We had an excellent time enjoying the good snow conditions and friendly staff. No lift lines. One day we were greated by a host who was offering to go up with us to show us the mountain and the runs. We much prefer to ski Bridger than any Colorado resort. We would highly recommend Bridger for all levels of skiing.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,5,"Make Bridger a must if you are planning to ski in Montana. Great prices, great snow, and nice chalets."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,4,"Having skied much of CO, some Cali, a lot of UT. . . . it was time to experience MT. In the Bozeman area (near) there are 2 spots and the small (non-resort) one is Bridger. We found this little ski area very accommodating with very nice folks. Ticket prices were about 1/2 of the major ""resort"" in the area and it was very convenient of a ""somewhat"" beginner and an experienced skier. It was easy to have a bite and relax and get back to the great runs."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,negative,3,"Fantastic fun for the family! Great runs, friendly and low key, totally uncommercial and anti-resort in nature, with a price point to match."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,negative,3,"Bridger is my favorite place to ski and mostly that is because of the people that work here. Don't get me wrong, the slopes are great. My kids are 8 and 10 and they can go up virtually any chairlift and find their way down without getting into trouble. There is truly something for every level of skier. The ski school is fantastic. We generally get our kids a 90 minute private lesson because we only get out a couple times each year and we have never been disappointed. Patrick is our favorite instructor and my 10 year old daughter requests him every year. There are 4 lodges that serve food and the prices are reasonable and the food is good. The people working on the mountain, whether they are serving food or running the chair lift are fantastic. They are smiling and happy and always have kind words. I have no idea why anyone would spend twice as much to go to Big Sky when Bridger Bowl has so much to offer. It is a short drive from Bozeman which has lots of choices for lodging and food."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,4,"Enjoyed a day skiing here, even with the warm temperatures snow was pretty good. Price was $54 for lift ticket half of Big Sky. Good variety of terrain. Grooming was not as good as Big Sky but with half the price to sky here it was ok. Able to park pretty close to lifts, good bar and restaurant areas."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,negative,3,"Good terrain, but slower lifts. Still short lines compared to bigger resorts. Be sure to get some of the famous fries at the mid-mountain lodge. But be forewarned, the serving is not for a single person-- definitely need to share!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,positive,4,"Bridger is a great hill! \n\nAffordable prices for a ski area ($54 for adult/$19 for children) &amp; not much waiting at the lift lines. Plenty of varied terrain for all skill levels. \n\nThe other great thing about Bridger is they are a non-profit &amp; not run like a typical ""resort."" There is more information on their website about their ""sustainability mission"" and information on carpooling &amp; the weekend shuttle system. \n\nThe cafeteria style food isn't anything too special, so if you want a healthier (or vegetarian) option, you might consider bringing a lunch. \n\nVery convenient/short drive from Bozeman/Belgrade area. \n\nOverall, we would love to ski there again."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,4,"Great local hill, been there before and got to cash in on my free lift ticket thru the Powder Alliance."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Mar,negative,3,"We had a great ski experience at Bridger! The benefits of skiing here outweighed driving to Big Sky \n\nPros: Very economical - young kids free if only asking on bottom of mountain, 20-30 minute drive from Bozeman, easy parking, rental, lift tix, children class sign up, ski school was helpful for our 6 year old and ended up being solo in group class, not crowded, very short lift lines, good slopes, modern lifts.\n\nCons: not as extensive or large as some competitors..., more limited terrain park, some longer flat areas down low.\n\nNeutral: Culinary/ bar options are fine but less extensive than larger competitors"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Mar,positive,4,With less than 1 week left before they close for the season all the lifts were open and all the caf√©s. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Never lines on the lifts and we almost had the mountain to ourselves. We have 10 &amp; 12 year olds and this mountain is perfect for them as well as my husband ( very good skier) and myself ( I stick to blues and short blacks). The trails were groomed both mornings we went. And the price of lift tickets is great; $18 for kids!! If you're looking for a great ski mountain that is a favorite with locals and not pretentious then this is the place. We try to come here every spring. It's only 30 minutes from bozeman.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Mar,positive,4,Bridger Bowl is about a half hour from central Bozeman on paved roads. It is a pleasant medium-sized facility with newer structures and services.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Mar,positive,5,"We had been to Big Sky at the beginning of our trip and found ourselves with extra time and a desire to ski again, so we checked out Bridger Bowl. We told the staff that the kids had had their first lesson earlier in the week and the kids were placed in lessons based on that information. It turned out that our youngest child was in a lesson that was not at the level where he was. The instructor took the initiative to move him to a class that was better suited to his experience and needs. (Huge praise for taking initiative!) After the class, all 3 of my kids raved about their lesson experience and teachers. My husband had planned to take them skiing the rest of the afternoon but sprained his thumb so he was done for the day. We went back to the office to see about having someone take our kids on some green runs for an hour since we weren't ready to turn them loose (and they weren't ready!) The office staff was very helpful, flexible, and able to accommodate our request. When the kids returned they gushed about their great experience. The guide told me she thought they were ready to ski on their own. Off they went on a few runs until it was time to go! It was a fun and successful day for all! Only drawback: the runs were a bit icy which made me very nervous (I'm not a good skier), but I don't hold that against the the people! Tidbit I learned: A staff person told me that wifi is being installed this summer and should be available next winter. There was no cell service while I was there. I hope we can visit again soon!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jan,negative,3,"Even though I fell and thought my collar bone was broken, I still had fun. The staff really helped out when I fell and got me down the mountain and to the aid station quick. Before my incident, I was having a ton of fun and was blown away by how beautiful it was and how great the powder was!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Mar,positive,5,"OK, the snow was marginal but this year having any snow is great. The price is right, only $53. The locals are friendly and quirky and good skiers; you have to be because the inbounds terrain is steep, with interesting terrain features and multiple aspects. Any chairlift that has an avy transceiver checkpoint before you can load has to be access the goods, and it does. And then there is the side country..."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Feb,positive,5,"We came from Big Sky to stay a few days in Bozeman and tried out Bridger Bowl. What a treasure - a short and pretty drive to the slopes, no crowds, price is right and great skiing. Wish we lived here and could take advantage of Bridger Bowl more often!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Feb,positive,5,"This is a great place to go skiing with challenging terrain, friendly staff and high speed lifts all for a reasonable price! The bowls are fun, the groomers are varied in difficulty and an overall great place to go skiing."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Feb,positive,5,"I visited Bridger Bowl with my daughter and grandchildren on Saturday, Feb. 21, 2015. After quite a few days without fresh snow, a recent overnight snow had produced new powder. As a result when I arrived I was horrified by the crowded parking lot. However, those fears were soon vanished. Parking attendants were efficiently directing folks into the lots. Once we got to the Sunnyside lift to gain access to the upper mountain, we only had to wait 9 minutes. Then once on top we had access to Alpine Way, Powder Park, Pierre's Knob lifts and never had another wait in line. I was amazed that on a very, very busy day for Bridger Bowl, how the mountain was easily able to absorb so many skiers. \n\nOur skiing experience was simply fabulous, as we spent the day skiing all over the mountain and taking almost all of the lifts, except the Slachman's lift, which requires avalanche beacons, etc. For lunch we decided to try the new Alpine cabin. What a great view of the mountain while enjoying a great lunch of brats, made from fresh local products. The previous week I had skied at BB and had chile at the Deer Creek Lodge. The BB chile is absolutely the best! (unlike the miserable stuff they now serve down at the Madison Lodge at Moonlight).\n\nThe employees in the food service and lift attendants were very friendly and helpful. And here's the thing about Bridger Bowl---what a FABULOUS VALUE!!! Now that Big Sky has gone big time and charges exorbitant prices, at least compared to what they USED to charge when you had the stand alone Moonlight Basin, Bridger Bowl is SO affordable, with great rates for kids, seniors, and they provide means for buying very economical lift tickets if you don't want to buy a season pass. One such example is the deal where if you purchase a set of ten lift tickets (all day) the price comes out to only $40 per ticket. What a deal considering the great skiing!\n\nOne more thing about BB--that mountain seems to really collect and hold the snow. I skied here a few weeks ago during a time when there had not been any fresh snow for a couple of weeks, and was surprised at how good the conditions were. No rocks, no gravel. Nothing like the conditions you frequently encounter as you ski off the SIx Shooter lift, and ESPECIALLY the Lone Tree lift at Moonlight with the rocks and gravel all over the place. I guess the wind funnels through those spots and does not allow the snow to collect. I still have dents and scratches from an earlier ski at Moonlight. No such problem at Bridger Bowl. \n\nFor this local, I doubt that I will ever return to Big Sky or Moonlight with their current pricing. Why should I when we have such great conditions, runs, food service and GREAT VALUE at Bridger Bowl!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jan,negative,3,"Amazing mountain. Really good terrain for everyone, from beginner flats on the bottom half to the crazy stuff off the schlasman chair. What really made me fall in love with this place and Bozeman in general though is the people. Everyone is super friendly and doesn't hesitate to point you towards the goods.\n\nCan't wait to go back :)"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Mar,positive,4,"We normally ski Big Sky but wanted to try Bridger. We will never return. The mountain doesn‚Äôt offer many runs or lifts, and the lines were very long on a Sunday afternoon. We had to use a tow rope (yes, the kind I used 40 years ago when I learned to ski) to get back from one area of the hill to the lift. It‚Äôs not easy. At 3:30- they close at 4:00- we wanted to stop for a beer. Alas, the restaurant was closed and no drinks were being sold any longer. No joke. Also, when we arrived for the day, we wanted to buy half day tickets and be ready to ski at the lift at 12:30. But they won‚Äôt sell the tickets early. So we all had to stand around at the ticket counters and wait in lines rather than them letting us buy the tickets early. There were about 20 people wanting to buy tickets. To make it even more humiliating, they blast the squeaking from a plastic toy chicken into their microphone when it was 12:30-ostensibly to let us know that now they would be so kind as to sell all of us tickets. It‚Äôs a nonsensical approach to wait until 12:30 and also to treat your customers so poorly. Don‚Äôt ski Bridger. Go to Big Sky where the skiing is always amazing, more runs than you can ski in a day, and the employees treat customers well. We will never return to Bridger."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Mar,negative,3,"We experienced one of the greatest snow days on our recent vaction. The lodge is very comfortable, the food was exellent and the sking was fantastic. We were there midweek and there was little to no waiting on the lifts. There are many diverse runs and excellent lifts. Looking forward to going there again."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Mar,negative,3,"I was told Bridger Bowl was a good mountain to ski, so I checked it out. It was pleasant. I went in the week, so it wasn't busy. There were no lines to the chairlift. I got quite a few runs in. There are some challenging trails there. It is a moderate sized mountain and not small by any means. The price of a lift ticket for the day is definitely worth it."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Feb,positive,4,"Smartly run local ski area with lots of vertical and terrain variety from family friendly to extreme. Lodges are very clean, well-designed and inviting. Definitely, a must if you are a skier and find yourself in Bozeman."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Feb,positive,4,"We have skied Bridger Mt. several times over the years and really lucked out on the snow this time! One day there was 19"" of fresh light (4-5% moisture) snow which was WONDERFUL to ski through--way less work that heavier powder we thought was good at home. As far as we could tell, there is almost no cell service there and in the canyon road area, at least with Verizon. We had spotty ""live"" spots, especially at the top of the higher lifts. The lowest lodge had useless wi-fi, but the Jim Bridger lodge had OK wi-fi. (Don't know about the other lodges). The weekend crowd made it almost impossible to get a table in the eating areas, but Monday was no problem, even at 12:30. Two days the wind was gusting so strong during the night and morning we hesitated to drive up from our rented house halfway from Bozeman (not a bad drive) but it abated on the mountain and we had good skiing. They have plenty of snow for good coverage, too. We took advantage of the Ski Alliance agreement with our home area season-pass so only had to buy Saturday tickets for our 4-days of skiing! It's just 20 miles or so from downtown Bozeman which has a fun quaint downtown, lots of hotels, restaurants, etc."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Sep,positive,5,Great snow in the winter and beautiful hikes in the summer. you can't beat the views and experience at Bridger
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Feb,positive,4,"Bridger Bowl is easy driving distance from Bozeman hotels at I-90 and 7th Street. The road is not difficult, even if it's snowing. The parking is free but does not have a parking lot shuttle. The food is much less expensive than at the other resort outside of Bozeman. Also the lift tickets are only $60.00 for the day, verses $140 down at Big Sky. The lifts have conveyors to assist loading, but are not high speed. Terrain is a little short on beginner runs, but lot's of options for experienced and expert skiers. This was my 2nd visit and I would certainly return for the good skiing and great value."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Jan,negative,3,"Loved skiing Bridger Bowl! Lots of easy trails but once you get above them, there‚Äôs lots of fun variety. Alpine lift gets you up into some gorgeous runs that smell like Christmas trees. Pierre‚Äôs Knob has some pretty fast/steep runs. The lodges are clean &amp; well-maintained; food is perfectly reasonable."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Jan,positive,5,"My wife and I are true ski bums...both retired and ski over 100 days each year throughout North America. In fact have skied about 40 of the top 50 resorts. We found Bridger to be a delightful ski experience and thoroughly enjoyed the day!! It has a beautiful setting, first rate infrastructure and fun terrain. Would certainly recommend this mountain. The only slight issue is the variety of terrain. Some of that was attributable to early season conditions which limited some of the expert areas. Overall this is a wonderful ski experience."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Dec,positive,5,"We hit Bridger Bowl on the first Monday it opened this season and really enjoyed our time there. It was our first visit and we loved how it did not feel like a big commercial ski resort and had more of that friendly, local vibe. Prices were very reasonable and the facilities were great. We knew being early in the season the base wasn't the best, but we still had a lot of fun and enjoyed the beautiful surroundings. We are looking forward to returning sometime in the near future."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Dec,positive,4,Decent skiing just outside Bozeman with reasonable lift rates. Food is low standard cafeteria fare. Free parking. Can't compare to world class skiing at Big Sky about an hour south of Bozeman.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Dec,positive,5,"It is real. It has incredible terrain for black diamond skiers as well as plenty of groomers. People are considerate. It is the antithesis to the dress-to-the-nines places. If you want a true ski experience, this is for you."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Apr,positive,5,Bridger Bowl is an affordable place for skiers and families. We took our young grandchildren for introductory skiing lessons. The instructors were fabulous. The kids were able to show considerable progress within 3 lessons. It was very affordable. Accessible from Bozeman.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Mar,positive,5,"This is a great community ski area. The kids programs made my kids into crazy expert skiers. The ""ski PE"" program is fabulous for MSU students at all levels. It is not a great destination resort: no on-hill lodging, iffy dining, no high speed lifts, but it is a great hill for a small price. The advanced terrain is world class - nice intermediate and beginner terrain but with slow lifts it is nothing special. It is however relatively inexpensive. I have had a season pass there for 28 seasons and I love it, but I live here and the convenience rules."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jan,positive,4,"We've been skiing Bridger Bowl for 15 years, since the kids were in backpacks. Now we ski all the terrain with them. It's a big playground, not as many acres as Big Sky but has numerous little tree areas that really are fun. Hiking the Ridge is amazing, the beauty and feeling of being on top of the mountains is well worth the price of admission.\nAlso hiking in the summer is really fun and beautiful too, especially if you time it right and see the wild flowers."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jun,negative,3,"If you want to ski or just get in touch with nature then this is the place for you. If, like me, you have hard, icy snow in your country then Brider Bowl has lots of soft, fluffy snow. There are easy, hard and bumpy runs, each with a spectacular view from the top. You must ski the bowl some time. In summer, an equally nice place to visit. The drive up to Bridger is part of the fun going under stone arches and passing rivers and ranches on the way."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Apr,positive,4,"It's a relatively small mountain, but it has some very intense steeps, especially off the top. When there is plenty of snow, and if you are willing to do some walking/climbing, there are dozens if not hundreds of lines between the trees and rocks that range from wicked to hair-raising.\nThe terrain down below is a lot more tame.\nThis is a bit of an old-school resort in that it doesn't have a lot of new, fancy equipment and the window-dressings of more affluent resorts.\nSome lifts require you to have your avalanche beacon and shovel. They check every time, so be prepared."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Feb,positive,4,"Awesome ski area, still affordable. Not too many bells or whistles, just the things you need. If you want access to the entire ski area bring your avalanche beacon and be prepared to do some hiking. If you know what you are doing, head for the ridge. If not, and you just wanna have some fun, head for hully gully."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Dec,positive,4,Bozeman had the best skiing in the world. There are no lines and there is enough hill to occupy all levels. The food and beer is great...best place to teach a child...low priced and excellent lessons! Taught my kids here at age three...The instructors taught me as well as the kids so I could continue to developing skiers after the lessons.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Dec,positive,4,"wonderful local ski hill, with a down home feel. Great terrain and way better snow than Big Sky. fun!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,positive,5,"Visit every spring for March/Spring break skiing. Friendly staff welcomes skiers of all ages. Equipment rentals, lessons, chair lift all super affordable. Trails for all levels well maintained. Locals on the mountain super friendly and helpful. A gem!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,positive,5,"Bridger Bowl is the only non-profit ski area in the US and prides itself on being a family focused hill. We ski there most weekends and enjoy the safe, family-friendly vibe along with pristine powder for all ability levels."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,positive,4,"Love Bridger Bowl. It is how I remember skiing when I was young. Casual, not over crowded, friendly staff, affordable ticket prices. It also is so close, that it is perfect for a couple hours of skiing without committing an entire day. I do wish there was more intermediate terrain. You are limited to the lower 2/3 of the mountain unless you are an expert skier and want to ski off the ridge line. Most born and raised Bozemanites are expert skiers having grown up on this mountain. But the rest of us..."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,positive,4,"Twenty minutes out of town, manageable lines wonderful services. Variety of runs for all level of skier and snowboarder."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jul,negative,3,"Was in the area visiting friends. They brought us up to Bridger Bowl to see where their kids ski in the winter. Even in the summer, the area is breathtaking..."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,negative,3,"Close, great terrain, cheap, and fun. When there is snow its one of my favorite mountains to ride. Its a must experience for sure."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,positive,4,"As a Bozeman resident, I prefer to ski here vs. Big Sky. I love the small town feel and locals only vibe but it's not a mean locals only vibe. If you fall, someone almost always stops and asks if you are ok or need help. Just a great place to take your kids skiing and to enjoy Montana skiing without all the movie star hubbub of Big Sky. Oh and great ski runs too. ;)"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jun,positive,4,"I love Bridger. I learn how to ski there 14 years ago\nFriendly people, a always willing to help. Very affordable!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Nov,negative,3,We bought a season pass and loved that we could go up easily on any week day and park a short walk from the ski slopes. I had an accident on the last day of the season and they took great care of me too!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,4,"After 20 years of visiting Bridger Bowl I have never had a bad experience! Great staff, great prices, great skiing, great food! The atmosphere is so refreshing and comfortable. Someday I hope to bring my children."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Dec,positive,5,"We got midweek passes this year and cold not be happier. It is only 20 minutes from downtown bozeman when the roads are clear. there are no lines on the week days, parking is easy and the runs are fast and fun. the lifts are a little slow but no one cares since it is so close to home and easy to get to."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,positive,4,Because there is no on hill lodging it depends on locals. Food and ski chalets are plentiful. But when it snows forget it all the college students cut class and head for the slopes and the place is packed.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Dec,positive,4,"My family of 4 skied Bridger Bowl over Christmas and found the hill to be really nice. We arrived and made use of the quite large 15 minute dropoff area to save the whining from the kids until later. Lift tickets were extremely reasonably priced and were a relief from nearby overpriced ski areas. Once we were on the hill, the kids had a blast. my 7 and 10 year olds easily navigated the blue runs and the lift operators were exceptionally helpful about reminding my kids what to do. We thought that the ""magic carpet-like"" lift areas were really neat and saved on botched loads. A great improvement to the hill! Our only complaint was the weather which certainly isn't anything that can be controlled. It was a very windy day which meant frequent trips indoors. The hot chocolate was good, meals were reasonably priced and bathrooms were clean. All in all a great day!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,positive,4,"We were attracted to Bridger for its impressive track record on sustainability and environmental friendliness. The prices are reasonable because Bridger is a co-op, and do not reflect in any way a lower quality slope. Fantastic variety of slopes from the easiest to most extreme. Fantastic instructors! If you go to ski for food, fashion and off-slope entertainment this is not your place. Make sure to take a trail map. as the trails are not marked in great detail. There is however a nice well marked ""easiest route down"" for those who need it. An excellent experience for very young children, (pre-K)."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Dec,positive,5,"Nice ski area w/plenty of varied terrain. Holds snow pretty good after a dump, Has everything from super easy to super hard. Cold. Uphill from parking, Decent prices on beer/drinks/some food Friendly staff"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Dec,positive,4,"I thought this was going to be a podunk backyard little ski area, it turned out to be an excellent area to visit, it had that small town family atmosphere with the attitude to go along with it, the more ski areas I visit the more I appreciate the family attitude. The mountain is expansive and terrain vast and challenging. They received 17 inches of fine powder the two days we skied there so there was plenty of POW to go around. I was disappointed that I was not able to ride the Schlasman lift, my Son did not want to ride it and I did not feel comfortable going alone as avalanche transceivers (457 khz) are required - Bridger should find a way to get at least one run open on the Schlasman lift where a avalanche transceiver (457 khz) is not required, although after seeing the Ridge Terrain, I totally understand their position."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Dec,negative,3,"Can't beat the price for kids, only $19. Decent variety of runs. .. Doesn't have some of the amenities of larger ski resorts. ..ie: some of the lifts seemed dated and slow, not many foot rests, runs not well labeled... However the snow was fantastic, we never waited in line (and it is a holiday week), and our ski instructor seemed to like his job! Eat early on the mountain if you are going to, they close must of those 2ish..then your only option is the bar in the lodge ..oh and they have a parking lot close in for cars with more than 3 occupants, take the closer parking families! overall we enjoyed the value AND beauty of this resort."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Mar,negative,3,"We loved Bridger! While it is ""smaller"" (fewer lifts, runs) than other mega-resorts, it is more than big enough to be enjoyable for all levels of skiers on a multi-day ski vacation. Lift prices (especially for kids) are unbeatable! We didn't encounter any lines/crowds and the snow was spectacular! Varied terrain - wide open spaces and trees and everything in between. We didn't cover any of the extreme terrain, but it was fun to watch from the lifts as other skiers tackled the ""scary stuff"". We will return!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Dec,positive,4,"My family hasn't ever skied before so we signed up for a family lesson - it was an hour and a half long, and reasonably priced. The instructor (Mariah) was great and worked with each of us at our own level. The place is well run and we had a blast! Thanks Mariah\n\nRyan, Alicia, Ali, and Josiah"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Dec,negative,3,"This is the best skiing in Montana, even the ""world famous"" Big Sky does not stand a chance against bridger bowl, this is the place to ski, with very reasonable lift prices, skiing for all skill levels, and pretty good food."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,positive,4,"It's just a short drive from Bozeman and it has the best snow. This is a local favorite and once you go you will know why. Other ski areas get more hype but if you are looking for a true ski experience, this is the place. Its the real deal."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,5,This is one of the original ski areas in Montana that has typically had excellent snow coverage and usually early in the ski season. It's terrain is also very family friendly and yet offers challenging slopes for those that want to push the limit.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Dec,positive,5,I personally have never ben there .my daughter goes there often and says it is a great place to ski.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Apr,negative,3,"Nice quiet slope. No high speed quads, but nice place close to Bozeman to board with the locals. Has some awesome snow and really nice runs. Combined with the cheap lift tickets it's hard to beat!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,positive,4,"While not exactly a ski ""resort"", Bridger Bowl offers a great ski/snowboard experience for all levels. Most visitors will stay in Bozeman, but there are limited accommodations near the mountain. Scenery is exceptional as is the snow quality and employees. Don't miss Jimmy B's or the Grizzly!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,4,"After moving to Bozeman from Park City, Utah I was quite surprised and pleased with this ski resort."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,positive,4,Bridger Bowl has so many options of trails for any level of skier. They are so family friendly! Bring your lunches or coolers! Tickets are very reasonably priced
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,positive,4,"We lucked out with a bout of cold weather and a modest snow fall on a Spring break Wednesday.\nThe bottom of the hill is pretty shallow, so there are quite a few spots that require poling or kicking to keep going.\nThe Boy goes to MSU and has a season pass. Bridger Bowl folks are really easy to work with. He's had good experience with the office folks and we were all happy with the on-site rental shop. There is another rental outfit right off the parking area that The Boy waved us away from. Don't know why. My rental skis were quite sticky and they cheerfully waxed them on request.\nAll the staff around the resort were really nice and seemed to be tickled with their jobs.\nThe on-site food options were surprisingly un-exorbitant. Typical fare."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,positive,4,"Spent two afternoons here, learning to ski. Great scenery, helpful people in the rental shop. I'm told the powder early in the day was excellent. My five afternoon runs were great!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,positive,4,"I wish I lived closer to this great resort! This was my fourth visit, and I love the setting, the runs (although I stick to the easier trails), and the great value with reasonable lift ticket prices. The food in the lodges isn't anything to write home about, but then, I don't go there for fine dining."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Mar,positive,4,"If you are an extreme skier, this is your place. The hike to terrain is just unreal. But of course that was way over our heads.\n\nWe are older skiers who prefer steep groomed runs. That is something lacking here. They have great intermediate runs and some very good beginner runs but nothing in between Oh my god and flat runs.\n\nThe lifts and facilities are first rate. The mid mountain restaurant is great."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Mar,positive,5,Took my family skiing last weekend and it was gorgeous! Next to no one on the lower part of the hill and groomed runs with slight powder covering made for a great day to teach my kiddo how to ski!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Mar,positive,4,"No fooling around here. Plenty of snow and powder. No condos,outrageous prices,heated chairs, villages with Jewlers and furriers etc. if you are looking for a Vail,chamonix or whistler head up the road. This family oriented and BIG time steeps,bumps,woods and nice people. The ridge andSchlussmans lift are hike up areas for which you need avelanche beacons. The rest of the area none. Enough gentle terrain as well. Certified ski school. Kids programs for locals every weekend. Also town races. Ski rentals and repairs very nice people too The way it used to be. Come join the fun but I am not telling you where my powder stash is."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Dec,negative,3,"The place is simply amazing, the mountains and the trails are awesome! We had a big group from beginners to advanced and everyone had a blast ! My soon joined the ski school and he got much more confident. We had some issues with our skis , and even being our personal equipment the crew was amazing to support and make out experience delightful and unforgettable! We can‚Äôt wait to be back !!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Feb,positive,5,Im an upper intermediate skier. The slopes are great. Enough black diamond runs to chose from There is a terrain park for those who want as well. Friendly atmosphere. there is an upper and lower mountain meal lodge. Been going for years. No lineup at lifts. A gem of a find.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Jan,positive,4,"Great skiing and riding located just outside Bozeman, MT. The mountain has a lot to offer with a good deal of varying terrain. The lift system is well laid out and seems to accommodate the crowd well. The lodging areas offer the necessities without the frills of larger resorts. Lift tickets are reasonably priced."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Feb,negative,3,"A smaller ski destination however PLENTY of skiing terrain from back-country/beacon-required ridges to nicely novice; no-pretense; no-glitz; affordable (compared to Big Sky); rarely lift-lines. A community-serving non-profit. Excellent ski school and competent rescue (required, alas, when a companion concussed on hard-pack.... it's why one wears a helmet, right?). The BEST!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Jan,negative,3,"Bridger Bowl is amazing! It was runs for all levels, and lots of them, you couldn't get bored. Much more reasonable pricing than Big Sky or other more famous ski areas. And the conveyor belts under the chair lifts are fabulous, more ski fields should utilise them."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Dec,positive,5,"My group of 4 adults thoroughly enjoyed Bridger Bowl! Two in our group had never seen snow or been skiing before and the lessons at Bridger really helped them out! My husband and I did lessons on the green slopes with an instructor who really helped teach us some additional tricks and build our confidence on the slopes, we hadn‚Äôt been skiing for a couple years. Bridger was amazing! There are a lot of runs and there weren‚Äôt big lines or crowds for the lifts! Very affordable price for the three day pass. Hope to be back soon!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Dec,negative,3,I typically ski in the Tahoe basin - i.e. sierra cement - and it was nice to finally experience some cold smoke!! This is a very nice resort with terrain that will please everyone! We were there over the Christmas holiday and even then we never waited more than a minute or two to get on the lift. Easy parking - and if you carpool it's even better. If you are in the area and looking to ski/snowboard this is a must!!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,negative,3,Most people are drawn to Bozeman to ski Big Sky. Take a day to ski the local hill and always check for the flashing light on the Baxter Hotel. Calling locals to great skiing. Bridger is half the cost and a great experience.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,5,I was in Bozeman for a week of work and took a day to get some runs in at Bridger. This is a great place for sking. It has runs and lifts for all abilities. Definitely enough to keep you busy all day. I skied the groomed slopes and there were Plenty of blue and a few blacks. \nPlus with it being half the price of Big Sky and a lot closer it was perfect if you only have one day.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,5,This is a relatively small ski area about 15 miles from Bozeman. Ski lift tickets are $53 per day and there are at least two ski rental shops at the mountain. I have always visited and skied during the week and have never had a lift line! But I suspect the weekends are busy. Several restaurants on the mountain with warming houses. Great place!! Friendly staff.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,positive,5,Ski here the most out of any other ski resort and love it! I would think it would be very neat if they did night skiing. I love the lodges my favorite is the deer park chalet. Jimmy b's in Jim bridger lodge has the Best food. All the lodges have the best fries me and my friends always look forward to eating them.-
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,negative,3,"This area is great to use. Don't expect high speed quads but enjoy the way skiing is meant to be enjoyed. Great variety of slopes, something for everyone."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,positive,5,"We love snowboarding in Montana. The mountains are less crowded then other states and usually much cheaper. We've been boarding for over ten years so we've been all over the US\n\nTypically we do Whitefish (love it there!) but decided to switch it up this year. Glad we did! It was a nice variety. \n\nI have zero complaints. It wasn't packed. We got lucky with awesome snow fall. Restaurants in the area were great. Locals were nice and helpful. \n\nWe decided to go here instead of Big Sky because of price and the fact we hate sharing the mountain with tourists. Even if we are one ourselves.\n\nDon't regret that decision, the mountain was more then what we needed!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,positive,5,"Went here on a Sat and the place was absolutely packed. Do yourself a favor. If you're here to ski/snowboard, just spend the extra cash and time to visit Big Sky."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,positive,4,"Good place for the traveller who wants to go snow skiing, but has to hire ski gear. Hire rates and lift ticket costs are much lower than other areas. Whilst I only went there once, I was pleasantly surprised with the friendliness of the other skiers. It is well patronised by the local community which leads to the community feel of the place."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,positive,5,"Having alpine skied all over the world I was wowed by Bridger. Not huge by those standards, but Bridger has everything to offer from fanatical steeps to easy cruisers, and the friendliest of people. Bridger is considered a college ski area but that should not deter any visitor and lift ticket prices are very reasonable."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,positive,5,"A perfect day of skiing at the best""town"" ski area in America.\nFrom the new lifts to the hike and ski ridge terrain, Bridger has it all.\nA mountain tour from Ric C. An instructor in the world renown Snow Sports school, made a perfect way to acquaint us the the old Bridger that we knew from the 90's.\nWow, awesome progress that exceeded expectations.\nThe new Alpine on mountain warmup hut is really cool.\nAwesome views and great vintage pictures throughout the building, make a hot chocolate stop an adventure on its own.\nThis should be a must do for any skier who is old enough to remember ""Cubco"" bindings."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Feb,positive,5,"Love the friendly atmosphere, great snow, nice layout! I'm a lifelong skier and enjoy skiing different areas around the world. Bridger is a gem. Friendly locals -- look for the singing liftop! He's dancing and having a great time. Makes the day really fun when you have an employee enjoying himself and getting everyone involved. Varied terrain. Plenty of beginner runs for learning, great hike-to chutes and steeps. I spent the day hiking and skiing chutes in 2' of snow from earlier in the week. Snow was great and we found several untracked runs to enjoy. It was fun to see the MSU math department skiing together!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Sep,positive,4,"But this is a beautiful place to visit even in the off season. Leaves are changing and there was snow this week (but it melted), still this long time bowl is as popular as ever."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Apr,positive,4,"Bridger Bowl is a great place to ski/snow board if you like friendly staff, good service and reasonable prices (lift tickets, food, lessons). 2013-2014 was an outstanding snow year and hopefully 2014-2015 will be too. Come and enjoy the great terrain, snow and fun."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Jun,positive,4,"Magnifent snow dotted mountains in June, tall green grass with variety of evergreen trees, creeks rushing with fresh snow melt, antelope, deer and eagles observed along the way, and a gorgeous colorful sunset late in the evening. Drive well worth taking to feel just a little bit more alive!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Mar,positive,5,"Love this local area, lots of hard terrain and fantastic snow, fewer crowds, great views. Sometimes they open late due to avalanche control and parking is awful, but it's worth it!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Feb,positive,4,"It had good snow when we visited, but it reminded me of an eastern resort. It certainly was not at all like the massive, steep and deep Big Sky Resort close by."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Apr,positive,4,"Bridger Bowl continues to offer, like everything else in Bozeman, serious, authentic, and challenging experiences and recreation without attitude. The mountain skews intermediate to advanced on terrain, but better access to beginner/intermediate mix came in the 2013/2014 year. This is NOT a resort, but a true local ski area that also offers significant advanced terrain and side-country options."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Mar,positive,5,Loved this place - great slopes for all different levels of skiers - from black diamond son to green-slope mamma (me) - we all enjoyed our day!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Mar,positive,4,"BB w/ it's new Schlasmans lift (or however you spell it) is the real deal. This resort is a powder pigs delight and if you like to hike, you're in heaven. Hit up a local to show you around the mtn. Real friendly &amp; kind folk for the most part."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Mar,positive,4,"Great skiing, great ski instructors, great equipment rental...oh and fabulous FRIES! Bridger is not just for the locals, this hidden gem is close to Downtown Bozeman - 25 minute drive and daily tickets cost less than the other ski resorts near by."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Apr,positive,4,"Still owned by the community, new lifts this year for lower ability skiing people. While, the ridge terrain is some of the most extreme lift served anywhere. Only $50 for a ticket such a deal."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Mar,positive,4,"A caution: No toilet facilities are at the sign-in cabin. So use the ones by the parking lot. A caution: Take the correct skis for the weather. (Otherwise, rent a pair.) The ice was slippery the day we went, so waxed skis were unsafe."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Mar,positive,5,"We were recently here for a YSL ski championship race. The lift tickets are reasonable (esp. when compared to neighboring Big Sky!). We find the Virginia City lift super annoying, but once you get beyond that, there are plenty of high-speed lifts and lots of good terrain. Snow was great and there is certainly plenty of terrain no matter what your level. Really enjoyed our time here."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Feb,positive,5,Our family vacation is to Bridger Bowl.\nThe staff is always friendly and the mountain is just awesome.\nI have skied many different mountains and I just Love this place.\nIt holds the snow great and what that means is it doesn't get wind swept like other mountains. \nThey have the best lift prices and a mom and pop feel to the place. Great for families with easy to extreme terrain.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Mar,positive,5,Over a year ago I rated Moonlight Basin as a superior value. That has now changed. This year Bridger Bowl installed two new chair lifts (Alpine and Powder Park) that provide better access to some really nice terrain--especially for skiing fresh powder and skiing through trees.\n\nMoonlight merged with Big Sky and is now very expensive--twice as much as Bridger. I will be staying close to home and skiing Bridger Bowl.\n\nThe main recommendation I would offer is to go early to get a decent parking space and to enjoy the uncrowded slopes.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Feb,negative,3,"Very nice terrain, helpful staff. Need to get there early to avoid a long walk from the parking lot. Wish they had shuttle service from Bozeman on weekdays."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Feb,positive,4,"Very friendly, helpful staff. Reasonably priced with the Powderhound deal. Good variety of runs for an intermediate skier over our four day stay. No crowds."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Feb,positive,5,A great place after a nice snowfall. The Ridge Terrain is fantastic and offers fresh lines a couple of days after a big snow (beacon required.) Bridger Bowl felt a lot like the club fields in New Zealand without all the pretentiousness and gouging of larger resorts ($51 daily lift tickets!) It is a ski area designed for people that are more interested in skiing rather than prancing around the bar in the lodge showing off new ski clothes. Check the temperature forecast as it can get COLD! Real cold.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Feb,positive,4,Loved skiing here. Had a couple of great powder days with the lightest drier powder I have ever seen. Went to Big Sky for a day but ended up coming back to Bridger because we liked it so much!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Feb,positive,5,"For about $50 (adults) and almost nothing ($17) for kids, it's hard to beat Bridger. Food prices were also cheap and the staff was very friendly."
Yelp,Snowbowl,10/21/20,positive,5,"Zip-line : 
The staff were awesome. If I remember correctly it was Hannah & Garret.. I am not sure honestly. They were amazing and definitely deserve a raise. When we first began our adventure, a member of someone's group was removed because they were highly intoxicated.  I was thankful for it because the man made my group uncomfortable. I had zip-lined before from tree top to tree top so I expected it to be that way. It was NOT. I repeat it was NOT. I should first warn you that if you do not like roller coaster that have drops in them, this zip-lining is not for you. I myself do not like roller coaster like that so I was in for a rude awakening.  So, the very first zip line was a short hike away from the entrance but it very steep. My only complaint about this hike is there was no time to catch your breath before getting on the zip line. Also, there was no water or drinks given. It was in the high 80s on the day we went. Anyhow, once you are on the line, they make you show them the moves you learned for flying.  I liked the idea of it but I did not like that you had kinda hang over the side (you are harnessed in but it was still scary). The first line was pretty short so I did not really decide if I liked it or not. After your whole group goes you hike up to the second line. It's not a bad hike but it is kind of long. Once I got to the second zip-line, I knew that this zip-lining was not for me. Once they got me all hooked in, I could not make myself lift my legs to begin my descent down the line. I should have turned back then because once you get that far there is no turning back. So, I did the second line and HATED it. I hated to feel like I was falling and could not slow myself down. Well, I could not turn back. So, I did the last two lines and hated them just as much as the first two because of the drop feeling you get when coming down the line.

Ski lift:
After zip-lining we did the ski lift.  I would like to give it 4 stars because the operator who was supposed to slow the lift down and give some kind of direction did not. When we walked up, we asked to get a squirt of his hand sanitizer bottle and he acted like an asshole about it.  Then, when we went to get on the lift he didn't tell us nothing after showing him the ticket.  He went back to reading his book. So, the process of getting on the lift was funny because it scooped us up at full speed and then we were laughing trying to figure how to get situated while we were getting lifted through the pulley system and bouncing around. The lift itself was a little questionable because there was a lot of creaking and squeaking noises throughout our journey around it. But, it was really long & relaxing. I would definitely say it was worth the money to ride. Also, the same man who was an asshole during the getting on process did not slow the lift or direct us on how to get off. We made a quick dash off while still going fast and almost fell because we were trying to use a wooden step thing & not get hit by the next chair. But, overall it was a great trip."
Yelp,Snowbowl,7/22/18,positive,5,July 2018 did the zip line tour on all 4 zip lines. Short hike at the start and had a great time zip lining. Guides were very nice. Ended the tour with pizza which was the best. Dusty gravel drive up to Snowbowl.
Yelp,Snowbowl,7/14/18,positive,5,"Took the 4:30 tour today with my running boos and had a great experience. There are 4 lines all different levels. After the first line we hiked about a mile to the next one. Lines 3 and 4 were easy walks. Three instructors were absolutely fantastic. I personally think they all deserve raises! Anyway, I had a great time and will definitely recommend this place to my other running friends before the weekends over!"
Yelp,Snowbowl,4/5/14,positive,5,"I've got the Snowbowl Love, and here's why: 
* this the real deal: the frequent/addicted/passionate skiers' hill
* rustic and comfortable
* wide variety of runs, something for all skiers -intermediate to expert (beginners will  probably be happier at Discovery, but learn more quickly at Snowbowl)
* friendly lifties, staff and instructors
* excellent food- they are known for their variety of great food and microbrews,  Bloody Marys and wood-fired pizza. 
* reasonably-priced lift tickets
* excellent ski programs
* ""Make friends, not lift lines."" (Jon-Jon) is the attitude 
* great community- fun, friendly and courteous
* professional, responsive and friendly ski patrol
* 15 minutes from Missoula

UPDATE 3/2016: we stayed at the hotel last night and can't wait to do it again! The rooms were modest but very clean and comfortable; the beds and linens are new and cozy. The kitchen is super convenient, although the restaurant was accommodating so we didn't need to cook. The hot tub was clean and hot; everything worked as expected; the bathrooms were clean; and the games and condiments in the kitchen were a nice touch. Everyone was super friendly and helpful...overall a very positive experience!"
Yelp,Snowbowl,7/26/17,negative,3,"A group of 5 had made plans to try the zip lines at Sowbowl. Based on our group size and the time of day, as their recording said to leave a message. We left no less than 4 messages over the span of 3 days. Not once did a single employee bother to call us back to confirm that our requested time was okay. We did show up and they were wonderful to us. The experience was fun but a tad slow due to the group of nearly 20. Nothing special that I have to go back for more. Appreciate the staffs friendliness and safety."
Yelp,Snowbowl,12/30/17,positive,4,My favorite ski place great terrain and the bar is awesome!  Snow can sometimes be iffy but that's the challenge!  Lifts definitely a combo downside and upside....limited uphill capacity means more powder turns all day!  Unfortunately they seem pretty unreliable and break down more than the average bear....
Yelp,Snowbowl,8/23/15,negative,1,"I wasn't allowed on the zipline tour because of my weight.  That's fine, but my group should have been refunded.  The weight requirement is barely featured on the website, and not at all featured on the waiver--the employees at Snowbowl even admitted they've been trying to convince their boss to make it more prominent.  (I can promise you that their policy of not giving refunds is a lot more prominently featured.)  The best the boss (I think it was Nick?) could say was that they couldn't up the weight maximum without increasing the minimum too, which I guess would interfere with all the 60-pounders trying to ride.

So thanks for ruining our Friday afternoon, and I especially enjoy being called out for being a fatass in front of all your customers."
Yelp,Snowbowl,7/17/16,positive,4,"This is a review for the zip line tour which has only been in operation for three years. We've only been on a zip line at big sky so not a lot to compare it to, but we definitely had a great time at Snowbowl. 

Andy who runs the zip line program is very professional, friendly and definitely enjoys his work. Reservations are easy to make online and email confirmation provided easy directions from Missoula to the mountain.  

The guides definitely enjoy their work as well and were professional, encouraging and got us going quickly. The zip line allows you to go two at a time, so it is a lot of fun to go with a friend or a party. The landing platforms are also nicely designed with counterbalance spring stops which make coming into the landing smoother and more comfortable than the lines at Big Sky. One of the neat things about snowbowl is that you only have to hike up one short quarter of a mile hike and you get three long rides with one short introductory line. Definitely a great time and well worth the $39 for cost.

Also definitely recommend stopping in at the bar afterwords as the deck is beautiful, relaxing, and the drinks are affordable. Definitely a great way to spend the day with the family in Montana."
Yelp,Snowbowl,2/1/18,positive,5,"Love this place. Can't beat a 25 minute drive from south Missoula.  Nice tree runs. Only downside for some folks is the poor facilities, but I don't mind. My whole family loves it there"
Yelp,Snowbowl,1/27/13,positive,5,"I don't ski or snowboard but I did get married at Snowbowl a couple of summers ago and had a blast.  My friends and I relaxed the next day with cocktails in hand, professional chairlifting through the late summer afternoon.

I am writing this review because Snowbowl has the BEST Bloody Marys and brick-oven pizza in the Zoo...furthermore, the food at our wedding was exceptional.  I highly recommend Snowbowl for ultimate summer enjoyment just minutes from downtown Missoula.  One thing:  I would stay away from the wings...they just aren't crispy enough; maybe if the cooks made them more crispy they would be delicious."
Yelp,Snowbowl,12/16/16,positive,4,"My husband really enjoys their mountain biking trails in the summer and the skiing trails in the winter.  Their chair lifts commonly break down, leaving riders stuck for long periods of time. They need to be upgraded. Their food is delicious. I'm a big fan of their pizza and hummus. Full bar is available. I have had several friends do their zipline and all had a great experience. The road can be sketchy to drive but a shuttle service is available."
Yelp,Snowbowl,2/25/12,positive,5,"Great place to ski, the access road was improved this year so it's a little bit less death defying to get up on powder days.   most of snowbowl is not for new skiers though, but if you like challenging expert terrain snowbowl is a great ski area.  
only two lifts so if you want to get to some of the further our terrain make sure you've got a fresh coat of wax on your skis, otherwise it can be a bit of work."
Yelp,Snowbowl,7/22/15,negative,3,"This review is for the new zip lines. for comparison I have been on a number of these throughout the western hemisphere. I think whoever taught the workers may have been overly cautious, but while the lines where fun and nice and long and high, you can not enjoy the ride. 
on all others we've been on, the instructions were similar in going fast or slowing down, you were able to what you wished. 
on these you had to watch the landing crew and go into high drag mode when the signaled you hence not being able to enjoy the views or speed at your leisure. the stopping system was identical to others we have experienced but could land at any speed. 
also the hike to the second line is grueling. other places have had some kind of transport up the hill like a surplus military transport or the like. 
the price point is correct for what you get with the exception of the lack of transport. 
the pizza was good but needs more sauce."
Yelp,Snowbowl,11/2/07,positive,4,"At the end of a long and winding dirt road (usually covered in snow) lies one  of most authentic (rustic) and fun ski areas I have ever been too. The mountain consists of 2 lifts, one to the 3/4 way mark and then one to the top. The weather up here can get ridiculous when a storm moves in and is not recommend in extreme cold. The view of the Valley is amazing as is the view of the Bitteroot Range, Mission Range and other less know Rockies Mountain Peak. If you want to get a little extra in, ski off the back and hike up to the ""Death Star"" for super fresh tracks. The lodge at the bottom is semi-new and serves great food. Careful on the way home as ""Bartenders Bend"" has claimed more than a few cars in its day."
Yelp,Showdown,8/25/14,positive,5,"Showdown is the most basic skiing experience.  It's simply a great hill, with great snow, a nearly private hill/experience on weekdays and Very small crowds on weekends.  While decidedly more level 1 & 2 oriented (green and blue), there's still something on the hill for everyone.  There's no attitude, it's not a fashion or money contest, it's just great skiing and some of the best prices available in the US.

I've been skiing Showdown since 1993 and it's a must-ski every winter for my family."
Yelp,Showdown,1/7/16,positive,5,"Great hill with all natural snow. Quite a variety of runs from basic greens to black diamonds. Very cozy, old fashioned ski hill feel. Best on weekdays!"
Yelp,Showdown,1/6/17,positive,5,"Today was my first time back at Showdown in a couple of years, and my experience today absolutely warrants a positive review. This morning we got out of the car w/ the thermometer reading -6 F and hefty wind gusts, and we were preparing for a ""grin and bear it"" ski day. Quite the contrary: the staff (everyone from ticket sales to lesson instructors) were all beyond friendly--lots of smiles and warm greetings. The temps kept the crowds away; there were no lift lines! And the liftees were awesome, very friendly, waving as we went by, remembering who we are--if only every ski hill operated this day. Showdown is family-owned, and they go out of there way to make you feel right at home. Several times the staff were so friendly asking me how my day was, I thought that I must have forgotten meeting them before. But nope! that's just how nice they are here. ABSURDLY reasonable prices, especially compared to the bigger (less friendly) in state hills and (even less friendly) out-of-state resorts. All natural snow, no blowers. I definitely recommend stopping by for a great day on the mountain."
Yelp,Showdown,12/14/12,positive,5,Visited this ski area today! I must say myself along with my family had a great time! My mom and sister never skied before and after about an hour they were going down the mountain comfortably! I used to ski/snowboard when I lived in Japan and thought I couldn't get back into the hang of it. The instructors Ben and Bonnie helped my family tremendously. Super patient! And very very nice! If you want to have a good time and maybe don't want to drive hours and hours away for skiing. Showdown is your place! The area is about an hour from Malstrom Air Force Base! (the roads are clear getting there and back)
Yelp,Showdown,2/28/12,positive,5,Outstanding skiing and great people! The food is pretty good too!
Yelp,Red Lodge,1/29/20,positive,4,"Great old school ski resort in the heart of Montana.  About 6 miles from the town of red lodge.  Not many green beginner trails but plenty of intermediate and  expert slopes including lots of tree skiing.

The food is cost effective and plentiful at the cafe and lounge.

Secret spot - if you have the abiIty, reserve the warming hut and camp out overnite at the top of the mountain.  The views are spectacular and the heat is fueled by a wood burning stove.  Hope it snows that evening so you get first dibs on first tracks the next  morning."
Yelp,Red Lodge,3/1/19,negative,2,"First off, this was an awesome mountain to ride. Lots of fresh powder and good tree runs. Lifts were pretty slow but I'm fine with that. Unfortunately the upper level decision makers seem pretty trashy because they charge people ""holiday"" rates even when it's not a holiday, and they don't disclose it on their website. So if you drive two hours to ride here you get a nice little surprise. How do they do this? Here's how, they make there own holidays up and call them real. For example, the end of February through April is all holiday rates because that's when spring break vacations are taken. So apparently that's a holiday now. Zzzzz. They must be struggling if they have to fool their customers into paying more when they arrive. Just be careful. Chances are it's a ""holiday"" when you're going... lol"
Yelp,Red Lodge,6/11/19,positive,4,"Where I learned to ski as a boy and where members of my family used to work ski patrol.  Pretty good runs about an hour from home.  Usually not too crowded, especially on weekends.  Only thing is that the mountain is on the leeward side of the Beartooths and so the snowpack can be lower than resorts further west.  Consequently, there were many years where half the mountain was closed.  Additionally, the outhouse on top of grizzly peak is probably the foulest one I've had the displeasure of using.  Otherwise, a great place."
Yelp,Red Lodge,2/1/15,negative,3,"Over all we had a nice time and almost everyone was helpful and friendly. There was a rude gentleman running the 3 chair lift and got upset when a little girl (5-6) lost her ski and  this mother of 2 tried to get it back on and asked him to stop the chair, he didn't try to help out just stood there."
Yelp,Red Lodge,2/9/16,negative,2,"I purchased my pass from Red Lodge Mountain reps at Scheels which is basically a pick 6 price for 7 days. When I got to the mountain, they tried to charge me for a day pass that should have been paid for.  I wanted to use the 7th day (the weekday). I was not allowed to despite my voucher.  There were no black out dates for this voucher.  The only restriction was that it had to be used on a weekday.  The day I went was a Friday.  I was told by the ticketing gal to wait at the customer service window.  A very nice lady there attempted to help me but couldn't figure out how to make the voucher work.  She called for a manager.  I waited for an inexcusible amount of time for the manager on duty to get to the window.  The manager (Annalee) refused to investigate the situation as to why my voucher was not being honored.  Her response was, literally, ""it's not my problem.""  Fine.  I said I'd like to speak to HER manager.  Annalee REFUSED to even call her manager.  By the time Annalee was done with her vitriol of not being able to help me, raising her voice to me, and refusing to bubble this up after me having to wait an inexcusably long time just for her to get there, it was almost 1230.  So much for ANY riding that day.  Fix your staff and get a better front end manager who possesses higher reasoning skills instead of being a concrete, shrill voiced wall whose only words are, essentially, ""no"" and ""I don't know"" coupled with variations of not-our-problem.

I messaged the mountain via facebook and was given sales manager Jeff Carroll's contact info.  Jeff set up a phone appointment with me to discuss this.  He never called at the appointed time.  He didn't call at all later either.  I emailed him wanting to bubble this up further.  He set up another phone appointment with me.  He made that one.  It lasted less than 5 minutes of him saying (paraphrasing here) ""do you want a refund or not.""  Basically, he was kicking me off of the mountain for his staff's refusal to honor their sale.

This incident was the last straw.  I have been to the mountain before and dealt with the exceptionally rude ""Old Man Miami"" as other riders know him.  I also witnessed bartenders serving blatanly drunk folks, patrons way beyond reasonably inebrieated, which is against Montana law.  These drunken folks then hit the slopes with no one stopping them.  However, if you dare not have a leash on your snowboard, you will be stopped and berated.

Don't bother with this place.  Go elsewhere where staff knows what they are doing and actually enjoy being there.  Go somewhere that is not as icy as these slopes.  Bridger is leaps and bounds better."
Yelp,Red Lodge,1/29/12,negative,3,"Decent place to snowboard for the area. Cheap lift tickets, but slow ski lifts.

Although, i still had a good time the ski lift guy ""ronnie"" was very rude to myself and a lady with 2 kids. I was very surprised that a small local place like this would have employees that treated there first time customers like that.

Next time i'm in the area i will surely drive the extra hour to Bigsky area.

Oh beware!! Montana law! You need to have a ""leash"" attaching you and ur snowboard while your on the ski lift."
Yelp,Red Lodge,10/28/15,positive,4,"Red Lodge is a hidden gem! The terrain is 100% mountain skiing with something for everyone. The experts can run the trees and beginners have lots of options. Lift lines don't exist. Snow conditions can be sketchy at times. Red Lodge can go weeks without snow and the early season can be a crapshoot. We went over Christmas 2014 and there had been very little snow. The runs were man-made snow and the big parts of the mountain looked to be closed with no chance of opening. Then BAM... four feet of snow in two days opened the whole mountain up. The temperatures were very cold though at minus 15 Fahrenheit and windy. Be prepared for the chill and it'll be fun. The chalet is old and outdated which I don't care about at all, but you might. The vibe is super chill and the staff are helpful and cool and friendly. If you rent the gear is good, but get there early to avoid the rental line. The ski patrol is excellent and fast and professional (we had to use them) so feel confidant that if something bad happens you'll be in good hands.  The lift ticket prices are a steal. We got out tickets on Liftopia for less that $30 per day. So if the snow is good, and the temps are good, the skiing will be excellent. If you're looking for frills and an excellent meal with awesome entertainment and a beautiful lodge experienc.... go to Vail or Aspen. But if you want a great mountain experience Red Lodge is great."
Yelp,Discovery,3/15/17,positive,5,"This place was amazing!!! My first time snowboarding was here yesterday. Everyone had amazing customer service and was super personable from the guy at the counter when we arrived, to right before we left a guy running up to me telling me I left my things on the counter (oops!) haha. 

Hugh was my snowboard instructor. He spent two hours teaching me from scratch how to snowboard. He was SO nice, personable, and patient. You can tell he really loves what he does and loves snowboarding. It was fun to learn from someone who wants to teach! 

I learned how to do it and went snowboarding the rest of the day. It was so fun. 

The facility was super clean, and the cafeteria food was delicious, although I was bummed they ran out of veggie burgers! 

Will definitely come again!!! Thanks discovery, thanks Hugh!!!"
Yelp,Discovery,1/10/22,negative,1,"Myself along with my group of 6 people will never
be returning to Discovery. We refuse to fill the
pockets of owners that do not care about their
customers. The owner and the old lady were
beyond rude to my friends and family in an
emergency situation that happened to myself. I
was in the wrong in the situation and made an
honest mistake. The ski patrol had to stay an hour
late to get me to safety and they made it very
known how big of an inconvenience it was to help
me. How it was handled by Ciche and Beatriz was
completely unacceptable. After the incident, Ciche
and myself exchanged emails, where his
disrespectful attitude only continued. The point of
the email was to let them know how we felt they
had handled the situation wrong with their
attitudes and disrespect. The ski patrol did an
amazing job tracking me down but the attitude that
came with it was unacceptable. I hope nobody else
finds themselves in a bad situation at the mountain
because you will be treated like shit and I wish that

Yelp,Discovery,1/16/22,negative,2,We bought tickets and lessons for our 12 year old daughter. Due to Covid we had to postpone our trip for one week. Management would not reimburse us. Poor customer service.
Yelp,Discovery,3/14/21,positive,5,"This place is truly awesome in every way! Impeccable grooming everywhere, including some super steep slopes on the backside that require a winch cat. As far as terrain goes, very few areas come close. Steeper than Sun Valley, more great bowl and tree skiing than Big Sky. AND no lift lines on a weekend at a bargain price."
Yelp,Discovery,12/13/19,positive,5,"My favorite ski hill in Montana. The snow pack varies from year to year, but when there is a decent base with a little fresh powder, it is incredible. Tons of really challenging stuff on the back side and lots of chill cruisers on the front. Both of my kids learned to ski in the Kinderski program at Disco, and they have both developed into excellent skiers for their age. Not really sure about the previous gal's negative review on Kinderski. Her kid must be a little weenie."
Yelp,Discovery,2/21/19,positive,5,Great little location.  Fantastic variety of cruisers. Challenging double diamonds on the backside.  After years of going to Whistler it's nice to see a resort that is simply about skiing. Bargain prices . Goof parking. Low crowd. Great powder.
Yelp,Discovery,1/23/18,positive,5,"It's my favorite mountain in Montana. Reasonable prices, a variety of runs from noob to you-crazy, and an easy to get to location. Oh, and the bar and restaurant deliver too."
Yelp,Discovery,2/16/19,negative,1,Don't do kinderski unless you want your child to stand around for two hours. No one bothered to call the next day to discuss this concern as they said they would. Discussed with the owner and he made me feel bad for calling. Terrible experience. Do not recommend unless you want instructors to make your kid cry then ignore them. Incredible waste of money with the worst customer service and complete disregard for the well being of children I've ever experienced.
Yelp,Discovery,1/21/14,negative,2,"The skiing is OK at Discovery, but probably not worth what they charge for a full day adult lift ticket. The snowpack is marginal year after year. It's low elevation and often gets some of the least amount of snow anywhere. When it does get a good dump, and if there happens to have a good base, the backside is some of the steepest and best skiing around. There are also a few fun cruiser runs. 

Beware when buying certain ticket products from these folks. Last year we bought a ""five pack"" of lift tickets that had ""no restrictions"" and were ""transferable."" I wasn't clear on whether they expired or not, so I called Discovery and asked the girl who answered if the five packs expired at the end of the season. I was told they did not. In fact my receipt for the purchase had all kinds of information about tickets, expiration dates for season passes, etc. but said nothing about the five pack expiring at the end of the season. The literature at the ski hill also says nothing about the five packs expiring at the end of the season. 

However, after driving more than 150 miles, when we went to redeem two of our three remaining tickets we were told that the tickets had expired. So our $160 got us two adult lift tickets. Big Sky rates! 

When I talked to the manager of the hill about this, he insisted that nobody there told me that the five packs didn't expire. He then went on to explain that they were counting on the fact that people like me wouldn't use all five of our purchased ski tickets. It seemed to me he was admitting that they were intentionally vague about the expiration so as to take advantage of people like me. I asked him if we could work something out, since I was told that they didn't expire. I offered to pay the difference between the increase in the price of the five pack if he'd honor the three remaining tickets on our pass, he scoffed at me and offered to sell me five tickets for $200, which is the normal adult rate.  

The manager was completely unwilling to take responsibility for an employee's assurances to me and instead essentially called me a liar, belittled me and went out of his way to be rude and insulting. 

There are definitely better choices for skiing out there. I know I won't be supporting this business again. I'll take my money, my bar tab, and my friends to a place that respects its customers."
Yelp,Discovery,1/31/17,negative,1,"After mistakenly buying a lift ticket verses a college spring pass at Discovery, we asked to trade it in and pay the difference. We had the pass around 1 hour before realizing our mistake. But the manager said no & wouldn't budge one inch.  Praying that this poor dud gets some badly needed training in customer service as his comments were belittling!"
Yelp,Discovery,12/30/16,positive,5,"What a fantastic place for families to enjoy some skiing. Prices for rentals lessons etc very reasonable compared to where I'm from in CA. Laid back, staff is super helpful and kind, nice lodge, clientele is awesome. Beginning lessons are very well taught. My daughter took a beg ski class and I took a private lesson with Becky - she gave me incredible confidence and really understands how to teach to different learning abilities. Only recommendation is to get there early if renting equipment - they are really calm and efficient but there are a lot of people in line at 1030."
Yelp,Discovery,2/14/16,negative,1,"For the price, long lines and the poor customer service I won't be returning not worth it!"
Yelp,Discovery,5/13/11,positive,4,"Georgetown Lake, Montana:  this is where both of our sons learned to ski when they were ~ 4 years old.  It's thirty minutes from Anconda, MT and ~60 minutes from Butte, MT.  It's perfect for families but also challenging for the advanced skiiers and snowboarders.  The lifts become faster as you pick the more difficult runs.  Lift ticket prices are reasonable compared to California.  There are many long runs to be enjoyed.  And there are at least three difficult slopes with too many mogels I won't try."
Yelp,Whitefish,7/18/21,positive,5,"Perfect way to spend a summer day as a family.  Our two boys 5/7 loved it and so did the grown ups!  Our younger son was too young to join on the ropes course but there was plenty to do while they waited. The staff was helpful and informative and it was a challenging and fun thing for us to do!
We love the alpine slide and tubing!  It's a little pricier than most local activities (about $200 for 4 people), but would definitely recommend!"
Yelp,Whitefish,1/20/21,positive,5,"Have nothing but great things to say about the staff at the Mountain Bike Center here at Whitefish Mountain.  The checkin process was clean and efficient, sized us up and had us out on what looked to be brand new bikes in just a few minutes.  

And the resort was well equipped for our excursion.  Lots of terrain, with easy lift access, and plenty of help getting up on the chair for the 1st time.  

I do have a bit to say about that 1st time.  Although I've biked a bit before, I had never been to a mountain to do so.  I expected, not without some cause, that there would be a variety of terrain options.  Just like a ski setup, easy Green stuff, Blue intermediate stuff, and Black Diamond hard core.  And on the trail map, there was.

It was a bit of a surprise that there was not a complete run of Easy terrain that was easy to access.  There was some mild stuff, but you could not connect, even from the rental parking lot, a circuit route with a lift that had a Green loop.  

Second surprise.  Green, well that wasn't quite so easy.  If you aren't a fairly competent off road bike rider, the easy stuff was still a pretty good challenge.  

Surprise number three.  Taking the easiest way down from the summit, that's 12.6 miles.  Ask me how I know.  

I had a pretty great time, especially before I fell off the bike.  Story for another day.  Good spot, lots of fun, but it ain't easy."
Yelp,Whitefish,1/25/21,positive,5,"After snowboarding in 3 different locations in Montana. Whitefish resort is the gem of Montana. This resort gets an insane amount of snow. There's so much powder here, it's heaven. I have never snowboarded in better conditions. Just straight gliding, and when you fall it doesn't hurt cuz ur falling on powder. If you go to the top of the mountain you can snowboard between a plethora of whited out trees. My jesus, the trees are absolutely beautiful, they are completed whited out, you can't see any green. As you come down the mountain you can see the lake, awesome scenery here.

I was able to board for $73 for all day on a weekday. Amazing price, amazing location. I will definitely come back. The lifts are fast and safe. It definitely gets cold here so bundle up.

For the price and scenery of this place, it's absolutely gorgeous, highly recommend you come here for ski season. Can't wait to come back."
Yelp,Whitefish,2/23/21,negative,3,"Beautiful views and ski runs.  Was quite cloudy with low visibility and icy ski conditions at times, especially when using chair lift #1. Must take blue runs to get to green trails if taking lift #1 & #2. Stayed at Edelweiss with nice views, kitchenette and hot tub. Snow bus also a nice perk to go into town.
A few concerns with the workers at the resort. One of the ski lift workers had gloves that said 'inspired to be a dirt bag'. Dan in the base lodge rental area was very rude when we asked about our ski pass not working at night (the 3day pass says nothing about night skiing being excluded from the pass). Lastly, on Sunday when standing in line waiting for ski lift #1 to open, an off-duty youth ski instructor from the resort was in line next to us (Isiah S. from NC) was making threats towards the tourists, saying 'is tourist season open yet? Can we start shooting them yet? When are these chickens gonna fly back to their coop?' He was also threatening to throw coins at people's helmets and had a laser that he was pointing in people's eyes.He was very loud and obnoxious and made sure everyone knew he was an employee at the resort. He even was purposely standing on the back of our skiis. NOT cool.
They are also big sticklers with face masks, even though the state  has lifted the mandatory use. Face masks even needed to be worn outside.
It was good trip, but had better experiences at Big Sky, Keystone, Breckenridge, and Copper Mt."

Yelp,Whitefish,8/17/20,positive,5,Went zip lining for the first time and Quinn and Hunter did an amazing job making it unforgettable! The zip lines were super fun and everywhere we went there was a beautiful view! 10/10 would recommend going zip lining here.
Yelp,Whitefish,7/19/20,positive,5,"Lots of fun summer activities; tube slide, chair lift, alpine slide and gondola ride.  Beautiful place too. One of my favorite places in Whitefish."
Yelp,Whitefish,6/17/19,positive,5,"While we are staying in the Whitefish area we decided to head up to Big Mountain and take the lift ride to the top. After a  scenic drive up the mountain we arrived at the lodge and boarded the chair lift to the top. The ride was great and the views of the mountain side were amazing. From hi king trails to mountain bike trailed, we saw them all. Once we got to the top the view was breathtaking. Pictures don't do it justice. It is well worth the $17.00 each. We had a choice from the chair lift or an enclosed gondola. The chair lift was for me.  On the way down you could see the lake and the town. The sights were amazing. If you are in Whitefish y'all need to do this. It was well worth the money."
Yelp,Whitefish,8/24/20,positive,5,"Went on August 7, 2020. Alpine lift and alpine slide were fun! Also dropped my card/id while on the lift up from the bottom of the alpine slide and I believe an employee named Aaron took the time to pick it up for me even though they were busy. Glad he did because I would have not been able to board the plane back to Chicago without my ID the next day. Thanks dude, you rock!"
Yelp,Whitefish,2/16/20,positive,5,"Great resort with unique features similar to that of other high elevations mountains. Friendly people all over the place.

Purchased skis after demo rentals from the village rental shop, Dave was an excellent and knowledgeable employee who made everything happen. Will always be buying my skis here!"
Yelp,Whitefish,7/26/19,positive,4,"Stayed here as a result of an airbnb not working out. So we had to drive to Glacier National Park every day, but all didn't mind. It was a very clean, nice lodge. Great value! Hot showers, and comfortable bed. The kitchen was somewhat well equipped. For the life of me though, I wish that there had been a better sponge to clean up the kitchen.  A scrubber and paper towels don't do it!  It was a nice place though overall for all of us to stay! May go back here for ski season, for it isn't unreasonable for a group to stay here."
Yelp,Whitefish,12/3/18,positive,4,"We are lift assisted downhill mountain biking fans and this resort lives up to the hype!   We were able to park our camper in the lot overnight and get on the first lifts up the mountain for day of fun riding, crazy crashes, excellent views, and good beverages at the summit lodge.  The lifts are quick and efficient and take you to the top where you can choose your skill level of ride down.  All the trails are well marked and maintained.  We visited on a weekday so I do not have a good feel for how busy it can get, on a weekday it was great!  I hope to return again soon for more summer riding...or some winter skiing!"
Yelp,Whitefish,1/1/20,negative,1,"Worst lift line corrals in the business, and now they're ripping off locals for parking. They won't stay open past tourist season because the tourists go away, and you always have to worry about plowing an uphill skier in the fog."
Yelp,Whitefish,6/23/17,positive,4,"This place has summer fun for the whole family. My friends and I went for zip lining- a two hour tour on top of the mountain. It was a great time for everyone with incredible views. They also have a scenic lift, children's mountain bike trail, and an alpine slide. Bar, cafe, and a cafeteria are all also in the base lodge.

Zip lining was $55/person. They also have a photographer taking shots throughout and are available for purchase at the end of your tour.

The lodge also has great wi fi available for those that might have some work to get done or just want to save some data."

Only issue was the condo we stayed in was not up to par with the resort. I was told the condos are owned and run by the owners so it was run down. I would highly recommend staying in the main hotel. And we went at Christmas time and the decor was awesome"
Yelp,Whitefish,8/11/18,positive,5,"What a great place for families to spend time! We came here in the summer and spent whole day at the resort. We did great short hike at the top of the mountain. Check out the nature room at the bottom of the building at the top of the mountain.  Kids ( 6 and 9) loved the alpine slide ( we did few runs), aerial adventure park and tubing. Lunch place at the base of the mountain had surprisingly good quality and tasty food ( tuna salad sandwich and watermelon salad were delicious!). Overall a must place to visit when traveling with kids!"
Yelp,Whitefish,2/14/20,negative,3,"Great mountain, small lift line, snow ghosts, (relatively) reasonably priced lift tickets and lodge food. Unfortunately, the ski rentals at the base lodge were a major detraction. My girlfriend is a beginner and our experience was abominable. The girl ""helping"" us got our rental form, grabbed some boots, dropped them in front of my girlfriend and walked away. Fortunately I worked is ski shops in my 20's and knew how to fit boots so I made sure her size was correct, switched her insoles and got her fit and properly buckled. The guy who got her skis asked no questions, just checked her boot sole size and handed her skis with no explanation. The skis were dry but ok and I made sure her poles were the correct size which they didn't bother to do. I don't know if it's poor management, poor training or just ambivalence about the job from gen z young adults but I remember when customer service and caring about helping new skiers in a sport that workers are passionate about was a thing. I would recommend the Sportsman and Ski Haus in Whitefish, they seem to have a better reputation, better prices and certainly couldn't be any worse, I don't think that is possible."
Yelp,Whitefish,7/21/18,positive,5,"Family-fun day spent on Whitefish Mountain. We took our two girls (3 & 5) down the slide. The line was about 30 minutes long, but both girls loved it. We then went up the gondola for the scenic view and lunch. My husband and I were both blown away by how delicious our sandwiches were. I highly recommend the turkey burger and the emu burger. Very fun day!"
Yelp,Whitefish,1/17/20,positive,5,"This is a reply to Sean D, one star review. To clarify on the parking: There are multiple parking lots on at the base lodge that are free FREE. There are three lots in the village,  two are pay lots. $5 & $10. There is also a FREE shuttle service with many stops around town. I think its important to clarify bc its irresponsible to leave a review like that. Doesn't help anyone visiting.  No clue with what his issue is with the lift ques.  They are organized. Regarding uphill skiers, what us the difference between an uphill skier and any downhill skier, NOTHING.  it's an object in the way to be avoided by the uphill skier as you would with anything else downhill, a snowboarder sitting, a tree, ANYTHING. And the fog is the fog so follow the orange dots."
Yelp,Whitefish,9/5/16,negative,1,"Don't waste your time or money!! We booked a zip and stay package for our honeymoon and drove 600 miles and 2 states to do this. When we checked in the man at the Kintla lodge check in desk was horribly rude. Our room was ok, small with a queen bed but otherwise fine. They have a tiny hot tub that closes at 10pm and didn't re-open until 10 am. It smelled like rotten eggs

The zip tour had been rescheduled because of weather, which is awesome that they called and gave us a heads up. Luckily we opted for the refund and my husband was going to just book the next day if weather would cooperate.

When we woke up for the 10 am check out (really 10 am? Too early) the weather was better so we packed up, checked out to get a coffee next door at the village coffee shop. We literally walked up between 10:00 and 10:01 and the girl just looked at us and looked away talking to her boyfriend who was sucking down some drink. Apparently the stupid coffee shop closed at 10. Horrible that she didn't even try to say sorry we just closed or even point to the darn sign!

Next try was to go to the coffee shop at base lodge where he was going to do the zip line. We parked and got in there and couldn't find an open coffee shop, was passed by no less then 8 staff while looking. Not one of them would even help. When we walked by the mountain excursion room and the zip line check in every employee was staring blankly and not one of them were any help.

We left. Completely disappointed in our experience with this whole resort!! (Katie and Suzanne you are the only nice ones) Worst staff ever! Everywhere we went staff just treated us like we were putting them out by even being there. Both my husband and I have worked in many different roles with customer service and just cringe at this resort. Never has it been so hard to spend our money somewhere!!"
Yelp,Whitefish,1/3/16,positive,4,"Where to start. This place is amazing. I rented a snoWboard and helmet. The price is just right! The lift ticket however for a half day is a little spendy.

The runs are amazing. The staff seemed amazing. The beer is cold, the people are friendly and the lift waits are short! I'll definitely be coming back"
Yelp,Whitefish,3/20/16,positive,5,"My boys ski, but I don't. They are loving the slopes. I'm hanging at the lodge at the top of the mountain. $18 gets you a foot passenger ticket up the lift. The lodge on top is full-service, with a bustling bar with local brews on tap. Heart-stopping views from up top! The bar/cafeteria area upstairs is crowded and a bit noisy. If you want quiet, go to the lower floor. Still great views, you can take your drink & food down there, and you might be the only ones down there. We shared some curly fries and they were surprisingly good, crispy and served with good ranch dressing for dipping. This is the nicest ski lodge to hang out in!"
Yelp,Whitefish,7/22/19,positive,4,"Great mountain. Excellent hiking and biking trails. Greedy, though, to charge for downhill access on the lift--the chairs are running anyway, so if a guest has hiked up you should allow free rides down. And what's with the lack of water at the Summit House? Not even a drinking fountain? You can do better!"
Yelp,Whitefish,3/14/13,negative,3,"his review is mixed and is more relevant to those traveling to the resort via Amtrak.

-- On mountain staff: 5 stars --
The staff here is amazing.  Super friendly and helpful.  My 9 yr old daughter kept saying throughout the day ""everyone is so friendly here"".   I had a lift operator come out of nowhere and offer to take a photo of me with my camera.  The ski instructors are great with children and after her first two hour lesson she was a much more confident skier and exchanging high fives with her instructor.

-- Wait times: 5 stars --
We stayed at Whitefish over a holiday weekend, MLK day, and they were also holding a big race.  It was their busiest weekend of the year and the longest line was only 10 minutes.   Most of the lifts are a minute or less, and some with no lines.

You can easily find runs that you will have almost to yourself.  The people at Whitefish are mostly locals or Canadian (no Europeans like at Whistler) and so it's a very low key atmosphere and people are courteous to each other.

-- Ski in Ski out: 3 stars --
The resort advertises ski in ski out access from their hotels and rental properties.  The ski out is super easy for both snow boarders and skiers.  However skiing back in is a challenge, especially with children.  In order to ski back in you have to traverse the lifts all the way to skiers right, and then take a fairly tough blue run to a long, fairly flat cat track.  There are no signs to tell you where you are going and we made a couple mistakes that required hiking back to the correct turn.

For you last run if the day it's brutal with children.  Adults that can ski blues well and have a good sense of direction will fair better.  This could be easily improved with some more signage and curing a green run higher up the mountain.

-- Other Activities: 2 stars --
We were attracted to Whitefish because they advertised activities like dogsledding and sleigh rides.  However, these activities are far from the resort and they are not supported with a regular shuttle service.  Dog sledding is 30 miles away and unless you have a large group and are going on a Tuesday, the you will need to pay for a cab - $50 each way.   Slight riding is only available to groups if 6 or more, so a family of 4 or a couple is out if luck.  

It's ridiculous - Whitefish needs to improve their shuttle service if they are going to market traveling by train.

-- Snow: 3 stars --
As of The third week in January, coverage isn't great.  There are bald spots all over the lower mountain.   It is nothing like Cascades in Washington where coverage is deep by January.  However, since it is very cold in Montana, the quality if the snow is great and hold up well.   We had no new snow our entire stay but it held up well to grooming and stayed fluffy (although packed down) off trail."
Yelp,Whitefish,5/17/18,positive,5,I worked here this winter and grew up in the area. After going other places I realize what a gem this place is... smart layout of the runs and lots of quality snow... of course this mountain is known for its fog but is what it is... keeps the crowds away...
Yelp,Whitefish,7/24/16,positive,4,"Zip line was awesome!  Our guide was excellent with us, as we had an autistic tween with us qho doesnt do well with big groups. We had a small grouo and were able to bypass a large group that was ahead of us. PIctures the photographer took of our group was excellent,  rates average for the area.

Two  downsides of our afternoon was the lobby actually. It is loud and echoed quite a bit, making it not only difficult to hear the staff at the check in counter, but was a majorly sensory overload for our tween child.
The second was zipline was the only activity OPEN when we arrived! We had planned a treetop walk, so a couple people in our group sat out as they couldn't zipline due to back problems."
Yelp,Whitefish,2/17/19,negative,3,We loved the resort but were disappointed by the terrain. There is very little tree powder skiing due to trees growing close together. We found best powder on edges of blue runs under main chair. Most of those runs are not groomed so what we hoped would be powder on groomed was pow on moguls. Also the top is 6800 so it is like cascade snow but drier due to extreme cold. Back to colorado or utah next vacation unless they groom way more here. Lodging food staff fantastic!
Yelp,Whitefish,6/30/14,positive,5,We just completed the adventure park ropes courses...It was a lot of fun. The courses are challenging especially the black diamond! I would recommend the park. We have skied here before too and it was equally great! Thumbs up.
Yelp,Whitefish,2/16/14,positive,5,"Have skied all over the world and Whitefish is the best kept secret...just tough enough to get to...but when you get here you are rewarded with world class skiing, hotels (The Lodge at Whitefish Lake), inexpensive lift tickets, great restaurants, rowdy pubs, and friendly people. This place may not be chi-chi like Beaver Creek, Vail, or Aspen; but I'll take exceptional runs and low key folks any day of the week."
Yelp,Whitefish,7/8/17,positive,5,"The 7-line ziplining was super fun! The guides were very personable and learned everyone's names and remembered them throughout! Will and Ruth were great guides! If you love ziplining or need something to do, I highly recommend this!"
Yelp,Whitefish,10/4/13,positive,5,"My friend and I spent our last day in Montana at the Whitefish Mountain Resort in late August 2013 and had a great time. The prices were not bad for what you get. Plus, you can't beat the views from the gondola going to the top of the mountain. We tried the alpine slide while we were there and it was fun. As adults we were fine doing it just once. But, they do offer ticket packages where you can ride the slide a couple of times if you like.

We also really enjoyed taking the gondola to the top of the mountain and were very happy we bought the round-trip tickets. The hike back down is over 4 miles long and we were done hiking after exploring Glacier all week. The view, as I mentioned, is fantastic from the top. We also enjoyed exploring the nature center, talking with the friendly and knowledgeable ranger there, and looking out of the expansive windows with their binoculars. Afterward, we enjoyed a hot chocolate from the bar and sat at one of the picnic tables on their deck outside. Then we hiked a few feet down the mountain and picked huckleberries.

All in all it was a great way to end our time in Northern Montana. I would definitely go back and this time also try the zip line and the walk in the treetops. We didn't have nearly enough time to do it all. But we would definitely go back."
Yelp,Whitefish,12/2/16,positive,5,"We did Aerial Adventure Park on a down day for a bachelor party a couple of summers ago, and it was awesome!  All the guys had a great time, especially the groom.  The courses are pretty challenging and it did take 30-45 minutes to go through 1 circuit, especially with 4 people.  You end up getting caught up in the fun and do stop quite a lot to enjoy the view of the course design, along with watching and encourage your friends as they manuever the course.  

Definitely recommend doing this over the luge/sledding.

Wish something like this was closer to home!"
Yelp,Whitefish,9/28/18,positive,5,"Our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 daughters,  10 and 11) had a great time spending a July day here. We bought the aerial adventure package and loved all of the ropes courses (lots of variety of skill level) , alpine slides and the lift to the top was incredible views! (Good food and beer at the top too). My kids wanted to go back the next day!"
Yelp,Whitefish,7/31/13,positive,5,"Go Do the Zip Line the Big Mountain !!!

Man, they have got this going on.... So organized and so much fun!
Friendly, helpful, and caring staff---you feel like you just made some best friends!  They remember everyone's names, hometowns, family members, and on and on....

There are 7 awesome zip lines now, and each is worth the small hikes to get there. Water stations are also a nice addition, as well as the photographers that take great shots (for sale after the zips) of the adventure.... I sure wasn't gonna risk dropping my phone/camera flying thru the air.  Worth the trip up the mountain."
Yelp,Whitefish,3/21/11,positive,5,"Just returned from a trip to Whitefish Mountain, and couldn't have had a better trip.

It's off the beaten path, for sure, but if you don't mind flying into a smaller airport (Glacier National) it's hard to find another mountain out west that's as close to an airport as Whitefish.  They get a solid base, lots of annual snowfall totals, and low crowds ...

Wait a minute ... come to think of it, don't go to Whitefish. It's no good. :)

*Updated Jan 2012* - decided on another trip to Whitefish this January and still in love with this mountain.  Virtually limitless terrain, for all levels of skiers, is available, and with the low attendance you can find fresh powder lines just about anywhere.  This is a gem - if you want a true ski resort experience this isn't going to be your thing (although they do have a very nice lodge), but if you want powder runs then you have to check out The Big Mountain."
Yelp,Whitefish,2/18/14,positive,5,"So so so amazing! Very friendly staff and so helpful. The photographers are great as well, we got some great photos of our trip. And of course the snow was absolutely amazing!!!!!!! Thanks whitefish for a great weekend! Only thing I suggest is to pack a lunch if you don't like burgers, chili, or pizza. The food was definitely not the greatest, I would suggest they get a burrito shack or something."
Yelp,Whitefish,12/20/17,positive,5,I'm impressed. Nice facilities. Efficient and helpful staff. Plenty of amenities. Great skiing.
Yelp,Whitefish,8/17/14,negative,1,"After hiking the Danny On Trail and starving, the Base Lodge Cafe was very disappointing. The buffalo burger, bacon, onions, and bun were all burnt (black) and not enjoyable. The onion rings were good and my boyfriend said the milkshake was good. But for a burger that's $13 (not including shake and onion rings) I would expect much better."
Yelp,Whitefish,8/5/12,positive,4,"We did the zip line and new aerial course this past weekend.  All I can say is it is great family time.  I felt safe and the staff is very courteous.  Bring a pocket full of money as it is expensive to do all you will want to.  The new aerial course is fun and both my 20 year old as well as 10 year old were challenged.  

Very much recommend."
Yelp,Whitefish,12/17/14,positive,5,"Great place to ski, snowboard, and relax. They have a bunch of runs and slopes open. The staff is super nice and helpful! The lodges have really good food and a lot of beer and drinks to choose from. The hot apple cider is really good and soothing. Awesome place to go!"
Yelp,Whitefish,12/29/16,positive,5,"Highly recommend for beginners!  Nice price of $22 (kids 6 and under free) for three of the green beginner chairlifts plus magic carpet. The magic carpet is a zoo, but chair nine is perfect for a kid (or adult) with only a day or two of skiing experience. Such a great run!  Gradual and scenic.  We saw deer from the chairlift.  There is even a nice view of the valley! Also loved the lodge and its reasonably priced fare."

Yelp,Whitefish,9/8/13,positive,5,"We checked out the Walk in the Treetops Friday morning and had a great experience!  Our guides were friendly, knowledgeable and made us feel comfortable on our journey.  The walk itself was really cool and afforded beautiful views of the Flathead Valley.  This is a must do when visiting the area!"
Yelp,Whitefish,3/2/11,positive,4,"A great hill to spend the day at with the fam.

Pros-

Gets a ton of great snow
Nice snow park for boarders
Good front and backside
Close to town
Many Runs and limitless terrain to explore
Several nice bars to relax and enjoy some beverages
Staff is friendly and helpful
Lots of friendly Montanans and Canadians
---- Go to Costco and get 2 lift tickets for $100 ($64 at the hill)

Cons-

Not a ""Resort"" experience like advertised, at least not like other high end hills  
FOG city, any given day can become a socked in toilet bowl of clouds. I have struggled finding the bottom of the hill at the end of the day it has been so cloudy.
It's rare to get good visibility.
The rack rate of $64 is too much for this hill. However the location drives the price. Regular skiers will always get the season pass which is a good deal.

All in all, it's a great hill and you will enjoy yourself. Just check the weather 1st!"
Yelp,Whitefish,3/3/14,positive,5,"My girlfriend's father lives in Kalispell, so they come every winter for a week of skiing. They love it. It's out of the way so not often packed, but the mountain and skiing are top of the line. This is my first trip in the first week of March. It's been the coldest it's ever been in March, lifts closed, NOT comfortable. As it warmed slightly, it started snowing a lot. It's been pretty bad weather, but the slopes are still really fun and great. My girlfriend's family are all hardcore skiers and she told me it was a solid Yelp 5. I don't know skiing that well, but she said it's comparable to any world class slope, just a bit removed. And unlike Colorado, not nearly as sunny. Also the snow is pretty light it seems - good powder, not much ice or heavy snow"
Yelp,Whitefish,3/17/12,negative,3,"Whitefish is a pretty decent mountain for beginner to advanced skiers.  It's very family-friendly, with a good variety of runs easily accessible from the main lift.  It's also a fairly big mountain, with four skiable peaks and more than eight lifts and t-bars.

During my visit, the weather was fairly warm and wet, but there was still some pretty great powder near the summit.  Some friendly locals showed me some great runs.  One required what I'd describe as a ""medium length"" hike, but the payoff was a spectacular stash of virgin powder on some great terrain.  Thanks, guys!

The resort itself is beautiful.  I was very impressed with the size, quality, and cleanliness of the room I stayed in.  That said, the bed was hard enough that it did give me some trouble sleeping, and for how many buildings there are in the ""village,"" there's surprisingly little selection in terms of food.

My review has been very positive so far, so you might wonder why I've only given Whitefish 3/5 stars.  Well, there are a few downsides.  First, although the mountain has a lot of skiable area, the vertical drop is only 2353 feet (717 meters.)  Compared to nearby mountains like Revelstoke, that's not great, and it's very evident in the runs.

While there is lots of good terrain to be found, the best spots are difficult to get to, and because there's so little vertical, the challenging terrain will only last you a couple minutes if you know what you're doing.  After that, you're stuck on long, slow, boring cat tracks to get back to the lift.  I really enjoyed Hellroaring Basin and the East Rim Face, but the former comes out at the bottom of a rickety old chair that takes forever to get back up the mountain, and the latter can be bombed down in a matter of seconds when the snow is good, only to leave you with a ten-minute slog across a mostly-flat green run.

My other complaint is that the resort staff don't seem to be super diligent about opening lifts on time and keeping guests informed about closures.  On the first day of my visit, the opening of the main chair was delayed by half an hour because rime from the previous night had to be cleaned off the seats.  I find that a little perplexing given that the chair normally opens at 9:30, which is already a half-hour later than every other resort I've ever been to.  Additionally, they didn't do a great job of communicating about the situation to the people waiting in line.  To be fair, ice-covered chairs are a safety issue and sometimes the weather causes unexpected surprises, so I'd readily forgive the staff for being a half hour late to open the chair one day.  

What I won't  forgive, though, is that on the second day the Bigfoot T-Bar was closed for no apparent reason, with no indication of its closure on any of the signs I looked at.  I know what you're thinking: why would you want to ride a t-bar anyway?  From what I understand (and from what I've seen of the area), the Bigfoot services some pretty respectable powder runs.  I was annoyed that I rode down to it twice only to find it closed.

To finish this ""compliment sandwich"" and summarize, I did enjoy my time at Whitefish, and it is a good resort.  Families will love it here, and if you're coming from southern Montana there's probably nothing better around.  However, if you're an expert skier or snowboarder--you eat black diamonds for breakfast and only start to work up a sweat when you're on a gnarly double-black--then you may find yourself growing bored of the mountain before too long.  If you're coming in from the Calgary area, there are a several better mountains within the same distance (for example, Kicking Horse and Revelstoke).  

Everyone should give Whitefish a try, but you might not want to book a week-long ski trip here if you're looking for seriously challenging terrain."
Yelp,Whitefish,7/21/13,negative,3,My family of 5 just stayed at the Sherpa in Whitefish for a few days with a goal of visiting Glacier.  The accomodations were very nice and there was plenty of room for us all. I don't know that it was worth the price but it was very nice.  (We loved being close to the pool.)  We loved going down the alpine slide and the Zipline the staff was very helpful. Everything on this mountain was pricey (especially for a slow summer day- and I bring tip cash with you).  Abbey and Jenny were awesome zipline guides!
Yelp,Whitefish,12/26/11,positive,5," love this place.....HUGE...lots of great runs....relatively inexpensive overall...great locals....unbelievably nice people on the Mountain !

THE only negative...it can be foggy !  

This aint Aspen...there are no massage therapists doing lift line massages...of course..there really are no lift lines !

The town...and other close by towns are very nice with reasonably priced booze...food...entertainment.

This and the variety of resorts around SLT are THEEE best places to ski in the USA !"
Yelp,Whitefish,12/30/14,positive,5,"I highly recommend the Ski Classes and the ski instructor Lori (from Ohio.) I haven't skied since I was a little kid- a super beginner. She was super experienced, super patient, super informative, super cheer leader even when I felt like I wasn't performing well. I took 3 classes with her back to back. Without her wisdom, guidance, advice, and most importantly, her enthusiasm, I would have quit after the first 20 minutes. I cannot recommend her enough!"
Yelp,Whitefish,7/9/12,positive,5,I did the zip line and what a blast!! Our guides were wonderful and made sure our group was safe. This is something that everyone should try once!!
Yelp,Whitefish,1/28/14,positive,5,"Great skiing, even better views! Our kids have been begging to ride the train and we finally gave in and traveled to Whitefish from ND on the Amtrak. The ride there was full of excitement and playing cards. It was simple to get to the Resort from the train station via a taxi.  The reservation staff found the perfect property to stay within our budget and had lift tickets waiting for us at the front desk. The property was so close to the slopes we could have skied in the backdoor. Beware with being so close also means the groomers are that close, but when you are tired from skiing such a skiing such long runs, for us flat-landers it is a big hill, it doesn't really matter. We had some fog and some sun. We wish they would keep the restaurants in the Village open longer as it was difficult to get a good supper. The ride home on the train was not as fun as the ride there. We will definitely drive next time."
Yelp,Whitefish,5/15/11,positive,4,"Whitefish, Montana: We ski / snowboarded right from our condo down a ""trail"" for about (3/4) of a mile to the main lifts.  Purchased our lift tickets and went up the mountain.  When it was lunch time, we ski / snowboarded down one of the runs behind our Condo, walked about 100 feet and entered the unit ...... that was really convenient!  Day One: beautiful day, could see Glacier National Park from the summit.  Day Two: foggy ... very foggy ... not fun!  The mountain is really spread out, tons of runs, very fast lifts, many QUADS... we will be back"
Yelp,Whitefish,5/1/12,positive,4,"Pretty good hill. As another reviewer said though, it can get VERY foggy here, and it definitely dampens the skiing experience. However, sometimes on the summit you can rise above the bank of fog, and then the view is breathtaking. Definitely recommend going all the way to the top first, don't mess around with the other lifts unless you have inexperienced skiiers with you. The lodges are awesome, good food and fireplaces! Definitely a plus when my feet are frozen! They have ski lessons, and smaller slopes for kids as well. Pretty good place to ski!"
Yelp,Whitefish,2/15/13,negative,1,"Very, very unhappy right now.  As a local, living in Kalispell, I've been taking my skibike to this resort for 10 years, and last sunday, after getting on the lift and taking a run, I was pulled aside just as I was getting ready to get on the lift, a 2nd time,  told they'd had a change in policy, and I was no longer allowed to use a skibike unless I also had short skis on my feet.  I wear Sorel type boots when I ride and always have so of course I can't hook into bindings and what's the point of the bike if you have skis on your feet too, you might as well just ski.  So, they refunded my money and sent me home.  1 big problem is, after all these years of allowing me full use of all lifts, say I'd invited a skibiker from outta state, they came with me, took a run, and were told ""uh, change in policy"".  Uh, wouldn't the outta stater be discouraged after, being told honestly ""Whitefish Mtn Resort has allowed me on the lift for 10 years"", spending money to come here and ...you get the idea.  Yes skibikes have not achieved the mainstream acceptance snowboards have, but remember back in the late 80""s when very few resorts allowed snowboards on the lift?  Over the years I have encountered liftees who were not familiar with skibikes, or me, and was sent home one evening after skiing for more than 2 hours.  I made a stink about it and the next day administration assigned 2 patrol to watch me get on and off the lift and ski 3 runs with me to see if I was a hazard.  Their conclusion was, no, my feet and boots never touch the ground when getting off the lift and I could ski with general traffic, keep up, and not create a hazard.  They apologized for the nite before, told me I was good to go and that was 7 years ago, no concerns or funny looks since then.  So imagine my disdain when, this season, after having already been up there with the skibike on New Years Eve, having the disappointment, and embarrassment, of being pulled aside just as I was about to get on the lift, being taken into the shack there, put on the phone with management and told I was done for the day.  Funny thing is, for YEARS, before the resort changed hands 5/6 years ago, they used to RENT skibikes.  Yes they were awful, clunky things and you were supposed to have skis on your feet also, but...My how things change.  So.  Being that Blacktail Mountain locally has allowed me to spend my money there with no hassle for 10 years, I believe I will have to grace their slopes with my unique sport.  bummer.  I have included a pic here of me taken at Whitefish Mtn Resort on my skibike.  This resort needs to appreciate the locals more.  WE ARE THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY PAY YOUR WAY.  facebook.com/photo.php?f…"
Yelp,Whitefish,2/15/09,positive,4,"Whitefish is a hidden gem and usually boasts some of the fluffiest, dry snow with over 120 inch base.  But this year, although there is a little over 80 total inches, it still is good boarding.  

The town itself is quaint and has good bars and restaurants.  Great winter getaway trip."
Yelp,Bridger,12/18/21,positive,5,"My wife and I had an incredible time! I'd been skiing a few times as a kid and she had never tried it, so we signed up for lessons that included rentals. Our instructor (Kristen I believe) was patient, talented & humorous and we had such a fun afternoon hitting the slopes. If you're looking to learn skiing in Montana this is the place to go!"
Yelp,Bridger,2/28/21,negative,3,"I actually really liked this skiing area. I got reservations four days prior. There weren't a lot of people compared to other resorts. For us, we were happy to have the great selection of greens and blues. This is a no frills place and didn't break the bank like a day of skiing usually does.

The staff for the most part were fantastic. With two notable exceptions and why I can't give a better review.

1) When picking up the ski cards in an outside window, the man in the booth was very rude to the woman in front of me..... ""Put your mask up"". So she did. ""Over your nose"". Keep in mind this guy was behind a glass window. And she was outside. Ick. He was nice to me since I had my nose covered with my scarf. Ridiculous.

2) I was with my younger son, getting on the Sunnyside lift. We don't ski all the time so at first it's hard to get your bearings with all the equipment. They had a mask bouncer at the beginning of the entrance of their ""masked zone"". My son was told to keep his mask over his nose. Which he tried but it loosened literally right when we were about to get on the lift. This guy walked over to my kid (who was on the end to my left) , right when we were about to board, so my son was distracted and I ended up going alone. I was yelling that he shouldn't go alone. So he went up with another family. Let's talk about this........ We were near no one at that point. Outside. Is it safer for my kid to go up with me or another family? And let's talk about safety. Shouldn't he be thinking about getting on the lift safely?

This sh** has to stop. I'm not sure if these people are just drunk on authority but that was out of hand. While everyone else was fantastic, this just pissed mama bear off. Yeah, you.... Dude in the lime green jacket at Sunnyside. Are you waiting for someone to get physically hurt on a lift for this to stop??? I'm shocked this type of thing is happening in Montana. I'm tired of the maskholes."
Yelp,Bridger,4/11/20,positive,5,"Bridger Bowl is an fantastic undiscovered gem of a ski resort that makes me dream about moving to Bozeman. I've been coming to Montana to ski at Big Sky with friends for a number of years. For the past couple of years my wife and I have come in to Bozeman ahead of everyone else to get a day of skiing in at Bridger.

In terms of size Bridger is not in the same league as Big Sky but it's still a very legit ski area. 2,000 acres and 2,600 feet vertical is awesome for a place that's only about a 25 minute drive from downtown. The people who work here are friendly and lift ticket prices are a fraction of the price of big corporate resorts. This past year we came right after the Bozeman area had gotten its first big dump of snow for the season and the crowds & lines were still pretty reasonable on a Saturday. There are no high speed lifts so it can be a long, cold trip up when the wind is blowing but with the low price of lift tickets you can't complain."
Yelp,Bridger,4/13/21,negative,2,"We were laughing and having fun, terrain is good! The Snow is a little heavy though (coming from Utah). Then ski patrol kicked us out for having a beer, which I NEVER thought would happen at a ski resort. Even in a place as strict as Utah that would never happen! Kind of blew my mind and definitely ruined our experience. Will only be go to Big Sky from now on. At first I was wondering why it was so empty, after that incident with the employees, I understand."
Yelp,Bridger,9/1/20,positive,5,Best skiing in the Bozeman area and only about a half hour from town and the scenery is beautiful. I actually go up in the summer and scenic area with lots of wildlife
Yelp,Bridger,12/15/20,negative,1,"Bridger bowl is an amazing place. Current winter conditions are not ideal. That being said, the current management has decided to take it upon themselves to restrict access to an outdoor recreation area to a specific number of people.  Not completely restricting indoor areas to those who do make the cut for daily reservations.  As for reservations, I'm not surprised that all 750 allotted spots went in a matter of hours.  Let's just see if the whole season will go that way.  Maybe they should be looking at how other resorts of similar size are operating in the area(Grand Targhee, Discovery).  Maybe stop all day pass sales instead of restricting season pass holders from doing something they paid for months in advance.   But I forgot they changed their mission statement from ""First to the residents of Gallatin County; second to the citizens of the State of Montana; and, third, to areas out-side Montana, and to do so at the lowest prices consistent with good business practice such as to allow the continued healthy operation of Bridger Bowl. ""  to ""to plan, develop and maintain facilities and services in a financially sound manner which provide the best possible skiing experience at a reasonable cost to local, regional and destination skiers"". Slight change of words big difference in who they are catering to.  Just a thought, wouldn't you want less people from out of state(day passes) skiing at the resort if they potentially are carrying covid and bringing it to a less infected Montana population(season passes).  I would rather the resort be closed for the season if your goal is to protect employees, that would make sense.  And if not,  just keep it open with whatever mask, social distancing policy they deem necessary.  Don't make the decision for people, if you are fearful of Covid than don't go skiing at a resort learn some avalanche safety skills and go into the backcountry where covid can't get ya. Some people cherish these seconds outside and their mental health might even need it.  Don't take it away from them, allow them to make that decision for themselves."
Yelp,Bridger,11/16/17,positive,5,"A family favorite since my childhood days.  My family visited Bridger before we even lived in Montana.  Then, upon moving, skiing at Bridger became a weekly activity every single winter.  I have since skied at many different resorts (Big Sky included) and nothing beats hitting the slopes at Bridger Bowl.  
I no longer live in Bozeman but have continued to visit and bring my own children here to ski.  This hill has something for everyone.  Not quite the value it used to be..I remember when a lift ticket cost $19.  But still a great time and a fun, easy going vibe."
Yelp,Bridger,3/8/19,positive,5,"Some of the best lift-served terrain in the country. A real side and backcountry mecca. If you want to access the most challenging terrain, you do need an avalanche beacon to ride the lift. It isn't hype to call this a strictly expert mountain. If you go here expecting a wide variety of terrain you'll be disappointed. I suspect alot of skiers have come to this mountain over-confident in their abilities, been given a stern dose of reality early in the day, and then been bored the remainder of their time there with the limited terrain within their skill level.

In summary: a truly EXPERT mountain. It is less a ski resort and more a backcountry access point. There's very little terrain for your average skier. There's also no nightlife. Big Sky is where you should go if you're looking for a ski resort

P.S. Skiers from the East Coast almost without fail overestimate their abilities. A ""double-black"" in Vermont does not equate with a double-black here. Not even close"
Yelp,Bridger,3/17/18,positive,4,Great local ski area with solid offerings for runs! We try to head up here from Colorado at least once a year.  Best days here are on the far right in the trees during powder days or in the North and South Bowls :)
Yelp,Bridger,3/11/18,positive,5,"My wife and I were lucky enough to enjoy knee deep flyaway powder two days in a row at the beginning of March...day two under bluebird skies with no crowds and open powder lines.

It was a great reminder of why Bridger is among my favorite hills in the Northwest.  It's a bit of a trek from Seattle, but it's worth it!"
Yelp,Bridger,1/24/19,positive,5,Awesome but the bartender seemed VERY unhappy to have a full busy bar! That's a gold mine but her attitude cost her a tip.
Yelp,Bridger,3/5/17,positive,5,"Best fries in Bozeman. The skiing is rad too. Add a Montucky for the full experience.

(You get more fries at the DPC than Jim Bridger)"
Yelp,Bridger,10/26/17,negative,1,I really love this mountain. But the fact that they keep raising their prices every year really shows what's important to them. This is a college town! Wake up! Do you think people are made of money here? Stop feeding the greed
Yelp,Bridger,2/19/12,positive,5,"Bridger Bowl is unlike any ski area I've ever been to. The in-bounds skiing is decent and there's a lot of terrain, but the ridge skiing is where it's at. There's an entire chair devoted to it, and you have to have a beacon to even be let up! The mountain is set up on a large face, so there's a lot of room laterally but there's not a front and a back side like there are at many ski ares. You have to take a couple chairs to get to the top, but once you're there they have a mid mountain lodge so you don't really need to go all the way to the bottom until the end of the day. It's also nice because it sort of divides up the mountain and keeps the beginners at the bottom.

Most of the really good skiing is accesible by hiking above each of the top lifts, with plenty of chutes that open up into incredible aprons for some amazing untouched snow. There's a huge variety of lines to take from just a little bit pinchy to more intense chutes with no-fall zones to some straight-up cliffs. The feel of the place is great, too, because the skiers that are hiking know their stuff and most of them are pretty bad-ass. I'd never really done beacon-worthy backcountry before, but I loved every minute of it at Bridger! It's kinda nice to actually have to work for your powder, and it's steep enough that sluff will fill in your tracks and you get freshies every time! If you're serious about skiing, Bridger is a must, but don't forget to bring your daypack and a friend to show you around!"
Yelp,Bridger,1/16/17,positive,5,"Had a three hour private lesson with Afton. I was nervous and a little embarrassed given I'm a young adult who didn't know a THING about skiing while all these little kids skied right by. But she made me feel very confident! She was incredibly nice and helpful, answering all my questions directly and really changing the plan to fit what I needed help with (for example, noting I needed more help turning back and forth so we focused on that). I'm not sure how the prices for packages & rentals compare ($57 for a day, $48 after noon, or $5 for the snowflake), but the ski lodge itself was pretty cheap. Obviously it doesn't cost to enter, but the food was good for the price! it's big and clean, which is really nice if you want to take a break from skiing. It has wifi, a cafeteria, a restaurant, and bar. They have everything you need for rentals--I got skis, poles, a helmet, and ski boots for $40 ($35 on Wednesday)"
Yelp,Bridger,3/25/16,positive,5,"Can't stop saying great things about Bridger.... They just get it.... Nice people, it's not crowded, inexpensive lift tickets, kid friendly, and it has a good bar!"
Yelp,Bridger,2/25/15,positive,5,"This was only my second experience skiing out west. I've skied mainly east coast mountains growing up, and the experiences vary.

But I truly enjoyed Bridger Bowl. It was my wife and three kids first time attempting a snow sport, and it had been about 14 years since I last skied.

I wasn't looking forward to the hour wait for rentals, but as soon as we walked in a guy was there to help us fill out our paperwork and we got out of there as a group in 20 minutes.

We had booked in advance, so we went right through all of the reservations in our package, and we were out at the Bunny Slope by 945.

The instructors were exceedingly friendly during lessons, and incredibly patient. The first day we were there, all five of us had lessons. It had been so long for me that I took the beginner lesson with my wife. We paid for the group lesson, but it wound up being the two of us with the instructor, and he was able to focus on my wife, which helped her a lot. My 2 sons had snowboarding lessons that was just them and the instructor as well, so they got a lot of attention. My daughter had a few more in her group, but she still did very well.

The second day my wife's lesson was in a group of 3, so it seems like they keep the group sizes manageable. My oldest son was the only one in his group, so it was basically an hour and a half long lesson, and at the end both he and my wife were confident enough to venture up the mountain a little ways. My other kids had great experiences as well.

Overall, it was an amazing experience on a mountain that had great conditions and wasn't crowded. My wife and kids can't wait to go again."
Yelp,Bridger,12/14/08,positive,4,"Bridger Bowl is a great alternative to $80 lift tickets at Big Sky. Not as much vertical Drop but at $45 a ticket and no lift lines it's just what the doctor ordered if you're really into boarding or skiing and not just being on the scene. Mostly intermediate & expert runs but a new lift requires you to take a shovel and beacon with you. It's named for a guy who died in an avalanche. Sound enticing?

The bar, Jimmy B's is pretty basic and so is the cafeteria. If you are wondering about the snow check out if the blue light is flashing at the Baxter Hotel in town. A flashing light means the snow is falling. Ditch work and get out here."
Yelp,Bridger,4/7/18,negative,1,"Watch out for Jeff the ski patrol asshole on the mountain!!!! He is THE WORST. He ruins lives and takes passes from skiers who are just trying to have a good time. On closing day today my friend jumped over a rope, there was nothing to say ""no jumping"" or anything so how was he supposed to know that his day would end by being escorted down the mountain by Jeff, the rudest ski patrol you will ever meet. My friend Noah was being very nice and understanding towards Jeff and was unaware that he made a mistake. However Jeff was so rude he made my friend noah cry and ruined his day, he told him he was happy to see him leaving the mountain and that he never wants to see him again. He very easily could have given Noah a warning but instead he took his pass and he won't get in back until 3 weeks into NEXT ski season. Noah could have easily out skied jeff the asshole but instead was kind and understanding and in return Jeff yells at Noah and ruins his whole day. Nobody deserves to be treated as badly as noah was today. If anyone reads this that works at Bridger ski patrol I hope you fire Jeff."
Yelp,Bridger,4/1/17,positive,5,"Really really excellent for first time skiers! I put on my first pair of downhill skis here and took a group lesson with Tyler B. There was only one other person in my group (on a Thursday, mid-March). The beginner's slope, Snowflake, was totally manageable and perfect for learning on--unlike some of the beginner slopes I tried in WY later the next week. I didn't get a chance to try Sunnyside but it also looked like an excellent next step for beginners after a half day or so on Snowflake depending on your confidence level. Everyone here was incredibly nice, patient, and helpful. I kept doing runs on Snowflake after my lesson and the girl running the lift was giving me tips on form and technique that were extremely helpful! I would come back to this place in a heartbeat. Plus their prices are very very low compared to nearby Big Sky and places further south around the Yellowstone area. Love Bridger Bowl!"
Yelp,Bridger,11/10/10,positive,5,"Decided I wanted to go skiing one december and started looking around for places in the states to hit up. Well. Bridger bowl had the cheapest plane tickets and hotels so I decided to hit it up for 1 week of skiing. I read some really good reviews about it and booked everything. Well. My flight got delayed a day because of snow so I knew that there would not be any problems with a lack of snow there.

I got a 5 day special which included rental gear as well. The skiing was amazing. The intermediate slopes here are like black diamonds in most other ski slopes. The black diamonds are harder than most black diamonds. The double blacks are ridiculous. They even have slopes where you have to hike to the top of the mountain. You need to pass a test and have a bunch of survival gear (shovel, beacon, etc.) if you decide to do this. There are so many slopes here that you will most likely not be able to hit every one up in one day. Luckily, I was there for 5 days of skiing so I was able to get every slope except for the ones where you had to hike up to the top.

The double black is ridiculously vertical. I avoided that at all costs until the 4th day where I mustered up enough courage to try it. The slope is really really narrow and if you make a wrong turn, you can go off the side of a giant overhang. There are trees everywhere you either go really really slow (like I did) or you are just really really good. And there are some people who are really really good and just flew down it.

There are also some slopes that if you veer a little bit off the trail, you can hit up a massive drop onto another trail. It's about a 1.5 story drop and people were flying off it. I figured, why not. Let's do it once. Well. Let's do it once turned out to be a bad idea as I wiped out pretty bad. Lost both skis. However, no broken bones nor major damages. Just a couple bruises and a hurt ego.

Overall, I had a blast skiing at Bridger bowl."
Yelp,Bridger,3/30/09,positive,5,"Recently visited Bridger Bowl on 3/10 after having just been to Big Sky for skiing the previous week. I must say I was impressed. Although it is no Big Sky, it is a perfect place to spend the day skiing. No lines, nice powder, and pretty decent trail map. The staff from the ticket counter to the lodge restaurant bar are friendly.

And - God forbid you do - but if you get hurt the ski patrol is experienced, prepared and super supportive. I had a mishap (broke my tibia) and Rob came to my rescue - he was awesome at keeping me calm and getting me to realize I needed an ambulance ride instead of my friend driving me to the ER. He held my leg in position until the medics got there and talked me through the pain.

They called to follow up on me two times the first week and sent me a get well card.

I will definitely visit next year!"
Yelp,Bridger,3/28/15,positive,5,"Awesome, fun family ski resort with runs for all ability levels. The even have a lift that you needed an avalanche transponder to even get on,  a bonus for extreme skiers/boarders. Of our two days spent skiing we chose to skip Big Sky and just ski here another day. Highly recommend."
Yelp,Bridger,1/2/15,positive,5,I went skiing after a 14 year hiatus. Took my 8 year old there for her first time. The staff was wonderful and she enjoyed taking the lessons. The mountain was beautiful!
Yelp,Bridger,3/3/11,positive,4,"I'd give it 5 stars if the food was better.  Awesome fun place to ski with dry powder, variety of terrain, no lines, user friendly with easy access restrooms, close parking, ski check and ski shops.  The food at Jimmy B's and the cafeteria needs help.  Not very good and not very healthy.  No turkey sandwich?"
Yelp,Bridger,5/14/09,negative,3,"If you're from Bozeman how are you NOT gonna ski here?  However, I'm not so sure it lives up to its self-proclaimed status of a ""world-class ski resort.""  A great regional spot that would be a real standout in any area outside of the Intermountain West.  But when you have Big Sky and Jackson Hole within a few hours drive it's easy to overlook this local favorite.  They avoid high-speed lifts here like the plague and for the longest time you had to HIKE UP to the top of famed Ridge.  They are constantly expanding however and like I say, if you're in Bozeman, how are you NOT gonna come here?"
Yelp,Bridger,2/18/16,positive,5,"Bridger bowl is the lesser known kid on the block but offers great skiing with open space and very friendly staff at a very reasonable lift ticket price. It's a noon-profit, community-owned resort that also caters to the MSU crowd. The ski patrol and first aid crew are first class, hands down. My skis get caught in the snow which caused me to tumble sideways and hurt my knee. I flagged some of the skiers by for help and they alerted the ski patrol team. In 10min Scott and his team were at the scene and sledded me down to their clinic where the attending sports medicine doctor was waiting for us. The doc examined my knee thoroughly and reassured me that it's an MCL sprain and not an ACL tear. The team drove my car up closer to the clinic from the lower parking lot so that I don't have to walk there to get it. First class service hands down. I'll fly there from California to ski there again and again!"
Yelp,Bridger,11/5/10,positive,5,Steep and deep... Powder hounds and sun dogs!
Yelp,Bridger,10/3/10,positive,4,"Been to Big Sky and Moonlight Basin, and looking for another mountain? About an 1.5 hours away from Big Sky in Bozeman is Bridger Bowl which offers a mix of excellent glades runs (check out Powder Park, crazy steep and narrow chutes, fun gullies (natural halfpipes, check out Avalanche Gulch), open bowls and insane cliff drops. If you're not feeling a bit intimidated and find yourself conquering everything thrown at you, there is the new Schlasman's Lift on the very far skiiers-right side of the mountain referred to as the Ridge Terrain. Please be aware that the Ridge Terain requires an avalanche transceiver while shovel and partner are highly recommended.  And if you're looking for a place to chill, roam around the mountain and you might bump into a few of the hidden smoke shacks. For $45 a ticket, I can't believe this mountain doesn't get more cred, especially with the variety of terrain it offers to all levels. My only gripe, the terrain park is small to nonexistent."
On the Snow,Whitefish,21st September 2020,negative,1,We snowboarded at night on Feb 16/ 2020 and during the day on the 17th. Lots of fresh snow and the condition was great both during the day and night! 
On the Snow,Whitefish,21st February 2020,positive,5,"So far I have skied three of four of my planned days‚Ä¶ All exceptional skiing days! The snow is much better than the snow reports, powder everywhere, some ungroomed runs with fairly deep powder. Yesterday (Saturday) Lift lines were non-existent, skied into the lift every time."
On the Snow,Whitefish,5th January 2020,positive,5,"Lines tend be non existent here, lift tickets and housing are affordable and the terrain is as good as any mountain in the country.  It‚Äôs clear that the original layout of the mountain lift system was not well though out 50 years ago.  However, we‚Äôve been coming here for more than fifteen years and have witnessed great upgrades to the mountain lift system by current ownership. I also hear there are many more upgrades in process. The addition of the flower point chair and moving chair 5 to the east rim area were huge improvements. Thank you!  I‚Äôve heard of upgrades to the Hellfire area and I hope they are considering upgrades to the right side (as you look up the mountain from the bottom) of the mountain as well.  Russ‚Äôs street might be the longest catwalk in the country so I‚Äôm hoping they find a way to reduce that trek by providing lift service to the top from that side of the mountain.  The fog can quite bad here but tree skiing helps and there are plenty of gladed areas around Flower Point.  You can‚Äôt beat the lodging prices at the mountain. They are a fraction of what you might pay in Colorado.  There‚Äôs not much by the mountain at night besides a small bar at the base lodge and Ed and Mully‚Äôs at the bottom of chair three.  The town has several great restaurants but it is a good 15 minute drive away. overall, we love this mountain and look forward to seeing the new upgrades.  It has its trade offs but the pros far outweigh the cons. "

On the Snow,Whitefish,5th October 2019,positive,4,"Skiing in December (visibility), January and February is cold and difficult to see most days unless you're lucky enough to happen on inversion weather. The town of Whitefish is great but lodging and nightlife on the hill is lacking. It has a small town resort feel which is nice until you ski Mammoth, Big Sky or Telluride and then it feels hopelessly stuck in the 80's. Spring skiing has been good, sunny and fun. Sadly Whitefish will close a full two months before resorts on the west coast. Food at the top is forgettable and slow, the bar scene is fun at Hellroaring, less so at Bierstube. All in all it's a decent functional local resort for Montanans and Canadians. Not a destination yet..."

On the Snow,Whitefish,10th June 2018,positive,5,"Tons of cruising trails for the groomer skier.  Tons of tree skiing for those who like trees.  Some cliffs, but not as rad as other ski areas.  Good variety, plenty of little ""secret spots"" for the locals to find powder a week after it came down.  Has mostly a local vibe still, but unfortunately that is changing.  Don't wear your Bogner and mink here, you'll be a laughing stock.  And save the cowboy hats for Jackson as well.  It gets cold here, you need real ski clothes.

Plenty of bars downturn for those who care about that stuff."

If you are looking for glitz and glamor, don't come here.  If you want a great vacation, relaxed atmostphere, and flat out fun, this is it.  Will be back again next year!"
On the Snow,Whitefish,9th April 2018,positive,5,"Whitefish Mountain should be called Whiteout mountain, the sun rarely shines and it is snowing very hard, very cold and foggy the majority of the time. When the sun does come out it is a great place to ski because there are rarely any lift lines, but caution DO NOT ski this mountain alone a person can disappear and never be found until the snow melts, a lot of very dangerous tree wells to fall into and die.  If you do ski it, don't ski the out of bounds area and I repeat NEVER ski this mountain alone even if you consider yourself an expert,  it is more dangerous than most ski mountains for a lot of reasons mainly because there aren't a lot of people who see you is you get in trouble if it happens..beautiful area tho with great snow if you are lucky enough to get a sunny day...Also, the very hungry Grizzly are waking up in Spring time and they have to close certain area's on the mountain.."

The locals seem to be able to do that.  Great tree skiing but don‚Äôt rely on them as sonar as they get completely covered in snow and are referred to as snow ghosts.  Bunny hill for kids is below fog.  They could use a few more lifts to access more terrain.  It has the feel of a locals mountain.  Don‚Äôt wear your Aspen clothes here or you‚Äôll stick out big time.

During the week and excluding the holidays, there are basically no crowds.  People are complaining about no apres-ski, but really downtown Whitefish has plenty of entertainment...  and what can be more entertaining than having a drink with friends after a long day of skiing around a log fire in one of the most beautiful places on Earth?  If you ask me, Whitefish Mountain Resort is a skier's paradise and I have been around.  It is a family resort, so maybe not for hipsters, even though I have seen plenty of youngsters enjoying the snow.  It used to be really popular with Canadians when their dollar went further and if anyone knows about snow... :)"
On the Snow,Whitefish,10th November 2017,positive,5,WMR is a year round destination located just 7 miles from downtown Whitefish. The small friendly vibe of the town carries to the mountain as people on the chair are sharing their experiences and their favorite stash if you're lucky. On sunny days you're treated with amazing views into Glacier National Park. The mountain itself provides good terrain across ridges and canyons but nothing to scary or steep. Every employee here greets you with a smile and people seem to detach from the real world around here.

On the Snow,Whitefish,29th January 2013,positive,5,"There are not words to describe how much I enjoy this place.  First off, it is absolutely massive.  You like groomers? There's tons.  Steeps?  Trees? Tons of that too.  I gave the terrain park 4 stars only because when I was there this year, they were just getting the fishbowl opened and there was just maybe a dozen very small features packed at the bottom of the run where the park is.  I was kind of disappointed because I thought there was enough snow to have done much more, but I know that once they get the thing built, it's pretty good.  Honestly though, as much as I like riding park, there are so many other places to have fun on Big Mountain that it didn't bother me in the least.  The weather can be a bit challenging, but like they say, snow comes from clouds, so what are you gonna do?  There are also plenty of nice places to eat or have beers, and overall, I didn't think the food was overly expensive.  Certainly no more expensive that stuff at our local places in Western NY and PA.  I definitely recommend going straight to be back of the mountain.  Great runs and still no lift lines.  The Bigfoot T-Bar is also a fun place to hang out when it's open.  I stayed with a family member in Kalispell, so I can't really speak to accommodations and/or nightlife, but the town of Whitefish is great and has tons of cool bars and good spots to eat (Buffalo Cafe and Great Northern were great).  Full disclosure - I'm from Northeast Ohio, so if you live in Utah or Colorado or something, maybe you wouldn't love it as much as I did, but I doubt it.  I've also been to Okemo, and while Okemo is great, Whitefish puts it to shame.  The vast amount of terrain and complete lack of lift lines make it great for anyone.  If you're an east-coaster or Midwesterner looking to head out west, I highly, highly recommend checking out Whitefish.  Oh, and if you want cheap lift tickets and have a Costco membership, the one in Kalispell sells lift for like 50 bucks.  Oh, and the staff are some of the friendliest people on the planet, especially the lifties."
On the Snow,Whitefish,18th March 2012,positive,5,"There are not words to describe how much I enjoy this place.  First off, it is absolutely massive.  You like groomers? There's tons.  Steeps?  Trees? Tons of that too.  I gave the terrain park 4 stars only because when I was there this year, they were just getting the fishbowl opened and there was just maybe a dozen very small features packed at the bottom of the run where the park is.  I was kind of disappointed because I thought there was enough snow to have done much more, but I know that once they get the thing built, it's pretty good.

On the Snow,Whitefish,18th March 2012,positive,5,"First, I have to say that I can only review a very small area of the mountain.  We're beginners so we didn't go to the summit.  They had really good green runs and it was neat skiing through the vacation condos.  And I know there's plenty of blue and black runs throughout the rest of the resort. The fog was pretty heavy our 3 days there, but if you ski in the trees it's not so bad.  It lifted a few hours into the morning, but again we weren't as high up in the mountain so it was probably worse at the summit.  But it snowed all 3 days we were there so that was a huge plus. 

We did night skiing there also and that was awesome.  Only 3 chairs were open, but it was our first night skiing experience so we had a blast. They're terrain parks were lit up also.  My husband and kids really enjoyed the ramps and the rails they had there.  

We had a great vacation and I highly recommend it if you are military.  We got 50% off all lift tickets and rentals.  Lessons are also 50% off, but we didn't take any.  We stayed in Kalispell which was 30 minutes from our hotel to the resort.  Not too bad of a drive and more food choices for us.  We also went on Presidents Day weekend and there were lots of people but I bet we didn't wait longer than 5 minute in any lift lines.  "
On the Snow,Whitefish,26th February 2012,positive,4,"For being the first time snowboarding out west, I had a great time at Whitefish. The mountain proved to be difficult for me and my friends because we underestimated the level of difficulty of some of the trails we went on. The trails were well groomed though and the scenery was beautiful when there wasn't any fog. The accommodations were great and there is pretty convenient ski shop in the lodges to get stuff at. "
On the Snow,Whitefish,3rd October 2011,positive,4,"Massively varied terrain, truely a great family resort. EPIC snow. Mid season the snow is as good as any resort in north america. and plenty of it. almost non existent lift lines. great village, has everything you need. fairly priced. Some of the best glades i have ever skied in hellroaring basin. powder stashes can be found days after  a snow. Incredible expert terrain in hellroaring basin and east rim. Just an all around great resort. would recommend it to anyone."
On the Snow,Whitefish,18th August 2010,positive,5,"At times there were more people working on the mountain than skiing. It was wide open where my skiing partner and I were the only skiers on the trail, working knee to thigh deep powder. There is plenty of intermediate terrain and the glades and back country are off the hook. The occasional dynamite blast over in the Hellroaring basin certainly kept it interesting. An amazing Telemark mountain, but the Alpine rocks as well. The cross country skiing is quite underutilized, but with a little attention could be world class. I hope to get out there again. It would sure help if they could get some more affordable flights into Glacier airport."
On the Snow,Whitefish,25th March 2010,positive,4,"I recently moved to Whitefish ski this winter. I had heard that the hill was fairly intermediate but very fun. My first day skiing here, I was guided by locals who have been skiing here for years and they were willing to show me all of their favorite in-bounds stashes. Now knowing the hill, I can attest that you can drop sick lines (by anyone's definition) at Big Mountain! From tight pinner chutes, big cliffs, double stager cliffs, and steep powder lines. Using the long cat track from East Rim and North Bowl is a little annoying, but it's worth every second of it when the snow is good! There's also excellent backcountry that is a very short bootpack or skin (10 min in, 15 out) that keeps good snow more often than not, especially on the North facing slopes. There is also lots of acres of great skiing for beginners and intermediates making it a great family resort. The Bierstube is a great classic Montana bar right at the base. Newcomers should definately go in and ask the bartender for a ring. Overall, I am super stoked to be spending the winter in Whitefish. Big Sky is definately Montana's best for steeps, but the Whitefish community is second to none!"
On the Snow,Whitefish,10th February 2010,positive,5,"My family and I love the town and love the people. We really want to like the resort but this past week has left us very disappointed. This was our second trip to the resort and the second time that we feel the Snow Report has let us down! 
This week they told us it was heavy snow which it was, but they failed to tell us that it was raining at the base and freezing rain at the summit. So the family all got dressed and headed up to the mountain (we like the hospitality we get staying at the Best Western, plus it is in town). We get up to the baselodge and the rain is coming down like back home on the Gulf, but we think ok must be snowing at the top. We get up to the top and it was some kind of sleet/ freezing rain that stuck to our goggles something fierce. 
Last year they told us it had snowed 8 inches. We hurried to get up to the mountain and it had snowed at best 4 inches, don't get me wrong 4 inches is nice, but it ain't 8. 8 is worth dropping the relaxing of vacation to get ""some freshies"" as my children like to say. 4 is keep relaxing, have a second cup of coffee and then make your way to the lift.
Now we haven't been to every resort but of the ones we have, these people tell the tallest tales and leave out important information that have affect just how gooda time a family can have on the mountain.

Enough of the bad things onto the darn good things. I am not sure that you kind find a small town to match the restaurants that Whitefish has, good BBQ, Pizza, and a some darn tasty chicken and dumplins...mmmhh better than mama used to make. And the people all over are down right friendly and honest (well except them snow reporters). They tell you where all the good spots to eat are, fun things to do after skiing, just the type of people we find back home. 

Anyway I recommend you give Whitefish a visit and if you decide to go to the mountain ask somebody at one of the local shops the conditions before you head on up."
On the Snow,Whitefish,21st December 2009,negative,2,"I live in Florida and have been coming here since 1990.  I like Whitefish so much I ended up building a house here a few years back.  As a seasoned skier/snowboarder my numero uno top things to look for in a ski resort are 1.)  No lines... hence, more skiing, 2.)  No celebrities...yeah , that includes you, Jon Gosselin!  3.)  No Mink coat shops... see item #2.  If you want family atmosphere, it's here.  Want gourmet dinners in town and nightlife, it's here,  Want theater and shows with Broadway talent and facilities to match, it's here.  Not only that, try getting out of downhill for a day or afternoon and take a short drive to Glaicier national park and rent Xcountry skis to hear a splendid silence of the park that is almost deafening in our plugged in world.  The silence and wildlife might just amaze some of the naysayers out there who find  Whitefish a little too, umm, ""foggy"".  Go back to Aspen and Sun Valley, it won't offend the rest of us."
On the Snow,Whitefish,3rd December 2009,positive,4,"The Big Mountain (as all locals still call it) is a true gem in a world of generic fake plastic jewelry. Yes there is only 1 high speed lift on the front side of the mtn. but that 1 lift accesses almost all of the terrain so why add more? Yes it can be very foggy but there is an unlimited number of tree runs to combat the lack of visibility. I'm not sure how anybody could end up on cat-tracks everywhere they went (granted that there is one very long road to return to the front side lifts from the North Bowl) as most of the runs are long, long, long! (some drop up to 2500 vertical feet) The groomers do an outstanding job of providing nothing but the best corduroy...and when it snows...oh baby is it good! It has been known to rain but then again all but the highest resorts run a risk of rain. I've seen it rain to 10,000 feet in Utah in January. The base village is OK but after the apres ski scene dies down there is absolutely nothing to do, hence the town of Whitefish. The genuine friendliness that you will encounter cannot be bought at any other resort. Don't miss a chance to try some other activities in the area: dog sledding, x-country skiing, snowshoeing, a side trip to Glacier National Park."
On the Snow,Whitefish,11th November 2009,positive,4,"4 of us (2 couples) in our 30's visited Whitefish over presidents day week friday to friday.  We stayed at Crestwood condo's between town and the resort.  We rode the train in from Minnesota.  Didn't rent a car so we relied on the ski bus to get to the mtn and taxi to get to town.  Each taxi trip was about $10. We spent far less this route rather than renting a car. All the bus drivers were very friendly and gave us good tips for enjoying the area while not skiing. In turn we tipped them well also.  Of the 3 skiers and 1 boarder we all enjoyed the diversity of the terrain.  I am a significantly more advanced skiier that the others.  On the first morning all of us took a ski with a couple of the Embassadors to get a good look at the mtn.  I would suggest this for your first trip to the mtn.  We skiid together for the first day then my wife and I wanted to tackle some more advanced terrain. It worked great to split up and plan on meeting for luch at the Hellroaring Saloon.  Great staff, food and booze. On the 3rd day after staying up too late and many too many cocktails the others decided it'd be a good day for the hot tub, pool and a stroll around town.  Not me, I was there to ski hard.  That morning I hooked up with an Embassador again for an introduction to more advanced terrain since my wife was not allong.  The Embassador was great and took me into the trees for some incredibly deep lines.  She also showed me some good intermediate trees to get my wife into some pow for next few days.  We did have some fog to deal with but not bad, like the other posters have mentioned it is pretty easy to find good visibility somewhere on the mtn.  There were definately a good number of people on the mtn over the weekend but we nearly had the place to ourselves the rest of the week.  Never did we wait more than 5 minutes for a chair anywhere on the mtn, even on the busiest days.  My favorite advanced areas where the hellroaring basin, east rim and elephants graveyard.  There was a lot of great intermediate terrain that I could slide off into the bumps and trees and reconnect with my wife at the end of the run.  I would have liked to have better conditions to ski the advanced terrain on the front side.  It was pretty chunky and no one was skiing it. The back was incredible though.  All in all we had a great experience at Whitefish Mtn resort.  I definately like the lack of the ""show"" crowd.  You know, the look at me and my fancy car, fancy equipment, fancy clothes and no skill type!  I will definately go back.  But living in the plains and only getting to the mtns once a year makes me want to check out other ski areas before going back to Whitefish.  What it comes down to is go up the mtn, ski hard, party, have fun, respect others and be thankfull God has given us the opportunity to experience such a beautiful mountain!"
On the Snow,Whitefish,10th April 2009,positive,4,"My family decided to go somewhere new so this was our 1st trip here and found it didn't live up to the expectations that resort claims to have, very disappointing.  This is not the place for new families to come.  We rented a ""ski in ski out"" condo advertised right next to the beginner area but when we arrived it ended up being a huge problem because ski school is far out of the way.  It really put a damper in the ski in ski out.  If you or your kids don't know how to ski you have to find a shuttle somewhere in the upper condo village area down to the base village area, which can be hard to find for some reason. Our trip had a couple days of fog and a few days of clear but the fog really outweighed the clear. It is true that most of the mountain has short ski runs followed by a long catwalk around the mountain i felt like I spent more time on flat catwalks and lifts than actual skiing. I would expect to find this at a little ski hill but for a major ski resort to only have one high speed chair on the front is crazy especially when paying  60+ dollars.  Also the eating facilities are stretched very thin up in the mountain village, if you stay there for 1 or 2 days fine but a week will get very old.   We also tried to go out and get some groceries in the village but the store was out of almost everything and was told that is just how it has been all year?  why even have one in the first place?  

If we were to come back I would stay in town and ride the free bus transportation to and from the ski area for a fraction of the price. and might wait for a better lift system.        "
On the Snow,Whitefish,9th April 2009,negative,2,"If you like skiing this is a great place.  Great skiing all around good terrain, good snow, friendly town, and best of all you don't have to wait more than 5 minutes for a lift.  I've seen the complaints about weather but we've had pretty good luck with that.  When it is sunny the view can't be beat.  Really this place is one of my favorites.  We usually hit up Fernie and this palce on the same trip.  Both great mountains!"
On the Snow,Whitefish,16th March 2009,positive,5,"Whitefish Mountain Resort is a great mountain! The people are friendly and easy going. The town has managed to retain it's old character while still being a vibrant downtown with lots of shops and restaurants. It's is just a couple of miles from the lifts with lodging and restaurants in town and at the resort. The locals always offer up suggestions and share knowledge when asked.

I'm an intermediate skier and have lots of fun skiing off of the summit of the mountain in any direction. There's terrain for everyone and plenty of terrain to keep you making fresh tracks all week. 

It snows a lot so you can expect snow clouds hanging into the upper half of the mountain at some point during your stay but the lower lifts tend to stay below the clouds and still cover a lot of terrain. 

The snowfall is big and fluffy and you'll usually find ""snowghosts"" at the top of the mountain in January and February. 

Views of Glacier National Park and Canada's Rocky Mountains are amazing and breathtaking."
On the Snow,Whitefish,16th March 2009,positive,5,"I have not skied there since renamed Whitefish Mtn Resort. Big Mtn is usually foggy during the winter months, maybe 25% of the time it is clear enough to enjoy the incredible views. There is a wide variety of terrain, generally something for everyone. While there is some descent terrain on the SE portion of the mountain, I don't like is the long catwalk (Russ's Street) back to Chair 1 - I'd rather be skiing than riding chairs and tucking catwalks. It's also a bit time consuming to get out of Hell Roaring and back to the top. Avoid the north side - short runs followed by a long run out to the lift. At least there is a high speed lift back there now, it was a really long ride before with very little skiing. "
On the Snow,Whitefish,15th January 2009,positive,4,Great mountain to learn to ski exterme terrain. I spent the winter here in 06-07 and still was finding new terrain to ride by spring. Had I come back the next year I would have found more new terrain. Lots of good hikes to steep terrain and lots of good sustained tree runs. One problem is that the mountain is growing in staure and more people are choosing Montana over Colorado. The mountain is developing quickly and without any prospect of stoping. The once small town of Whitefish is now becoming a one with the much larger Kalispell. finding afordable places to stay is also difficult.

On the Snow,Whitefish,21st December 2008,positive,4,"I learned to ski at Big Mountain in 1988 and I've been back just about every year since.  Big Mountain offers something for everyone.  There's a ton of intermediate terrain and enough advanced/expert to keep it interesting.  A lot of my days at Big Mountain have been in the fog, but you really don't notice it in the trees.  When it is clear, the views are unbelievable.  Great folks up there, both the locals and the employees.  In my mind there is just something special about this place that I haven't found any where else. 

My only complaint is the name change.  ""Happy birthday Grandpa....we decided to change your name!"""
On the Snow,Whitefish,17th October 2008,positive,5,"Last winter the new management cut one half hour from each afternoon because ""it's too dangerous to ski at that hour"".  

Sounds like happy hour wasn't making them enough money.

When it was revealed that promotional material from the resort claimed that the lifts were open 'til 4:30 PM, but closed at 4:00 PM, management said it was a ""misprint"".

Not very skier friendly.  The hot tub was GREEN at the Morning Eagle.  We specified that we wanted a hot tub, but I guess that cleaning it would cost extra.  They already told us they wanted $20 for extra towels.

Stay away until this ugly, apparently hostile takeover is resolved."
On the Snow,Whitefish,11th June 2008,negative,2,"I agree with the last review, we have been coming for many years and my kids say the terrain park facilities are a big hit for them.  They prefer Snoqualmies park but they say the half pipe was a huge surprise to them.  It was better than any other pipe here in Washington.  Way to go Big Mountain.  The fog can be overwhelming at times but usually isn't to bad.  We will be back.       "
On the Snow,Whitefish,3rd June 2008,positive,4,"        Overall I do not feel that Whitefish Mountain Resort (aka the Big Mountain) is worth the ranking of a Top 25 resort. It is really more of a locals ski hill with on mountain lodging. Being from Seattle I have access to a number of ski areas with in reasonable distances. I have made two trips out to the Big Mountain. The first time there was fog every single day of my 5 day trip. The fog was so thick sometimes that I got vertigo. 
	
But I did not want that to judge it just based on the one trip. So I went back again for 5 days and once again it was foggy the entire time. I took a tour with the Mountain Ambassadors who were really nice and told me the way to beat the fog was to ski the trees. Now I know that I am not an expert skier, but I am definitely an intermediate and the trees at Big Mountain are too tight for intermediate skiers. 
	
So in my conclusion the mountain may have great terrain but for the normal skier it is too foggy with too tight of trees. The one great thing they have over other ski areas like them is a great Half Pipe, my kids love it! 

Having skied at a number of places from Whistler, to Crystal to Jackson and I would recommend if you are looking for a low key resort with a great little town attached you should definitely go to Schweitzer in Idaho. The trees are perfectly gladded and the people are just as friendly as at Big Mountain.

Oh and management if you read this, change your logo back. I did not buy any memorbilla this time because of your ugly fish. It is quite possibly the worst logo of all ski resorts. "
On the Snow,Whitefish,30th May 2008,negative,2,"I snowboard here because I like the lack of crowds, steep pitches, and crummy weather keeping the crowds down and the snow good.  Thank god for the socked in weather because otherwise we would have way to many people here and this actually would be a ""resort"".  For those who like to ski and snowboard come on out here and those who like to whine and compare here to there; go there instead this winter, you'll most likely get better weather, better service and better skiing.  Besides the summertime in Whitefish is really where its at. Incredible golf courses that are affordable, fishing, biking, rafting, hiking, long days...the list goes on.    "
On the Snow,Whitefish,20th May 2008,positive,5,"FOG..yes this place does have poor visibility. For the people that wrote good reviews for this place and did not mention this probably do not ski very well.  Personally I love the foggy conditions.  Why?.. one might ask, well because of a few reasons.  One is that I love to ride in the trees and when riding between them the fog does not matter at all. 2nd..it keeps the snow from getting sun baked and my face getting tenderized to a piece of leather.  3rd.. it keeps all the bad skiers in the house and more snow for me:-) 
       
      So its true.. We might not have the best terrain, best snow, best terrain parks, best lift system, best places to stay, best visibility, and for sure not the best place to hang out for the apres specials. BUT.......When you take it all in we AVERAGE OUT FAR BETTER THAN MOST OTHER SKI RESORTS! It would be nice to see a better lift system though..cat tracks to get around the whole mountain reminds me of skiing in 1984. A ""new lift"" not just an updated one labeled as new would really set this place right.

Two lifts out our back door, one lift out the front. Bierstube next door, Ed & Mullys across the road. The people are extremely friendly.

I've lived in a lot of places and I kept coming back to Whitefish because it's the nicest damn bunch of unpretentious people I've ever met. This place is, literally, paradise. Every outdoor activity you could ever want within minutes of your doorstep. The skiing is amazing (especially this year.. thanks Mother Nature!). As far as sun... whatever... I'll take 3-4"" fresh seemingly every single fricking day than 1 big two foot dump and then nothing for weeks (*cough* Colorado *cough*). I won't even tell you about the many beautiful blue sky mountain inversions we get each season because they are my personal religion and I don't really feel like sharing how gorgeous they are! Shhh! Go away... nothing to see here. ;-p

So we has a couple lift lines for a week over Christmas... they still were less than any average mid-week line most other places. I can handle one week of sharing this place with a few others and having the whole place to myself for the other 17 weeks of the season. Haha!

The name change makes sense to me (no more my old, daft Pappy saying, ""hey son.. coming out to visit you in Big Sky again"".. uh wrong again Paps). It'll always be The Big to locals. *shrug* It's just a name... move on with your life...

Anyway, you rock on with your gospel truth Donnie! Don't let the whiners get to you... they'll leave soon enough and realize how awesome Whitefish really is and come back and apologize... you'll see. :-)

Also, Whitefish Mountain is turing into a Real Estate Company that just happens to own a ski area.  Also, the prices aren't super overpriced, but they aren't the greatest deals ever.

Just to set the record straight about some other things: 

1. On average, the moisture content of our snow is somewhere between Utah (super dry) and Washington (super wet). This year, it has been really low (dry), and if you were to go skiing right now, you'd find some really light, fluffy powder just sitting there, saying, ""I'm dryer than usual, ski through me please.""

2. I moved here just over 4 years ago now, and I have to agree with the poster who said Whitefish is one of the most laid back places he/she has ever been. I love it here, and I'm not stuck up, as far as anyone has made me aware. I drive a 1992 Chevy Truck with a crooked bumper, a cracked windshield, and some missing trim. I have found that this place is a wonderful mix of poor, wealthy, and everything in between, and that most everyone gets along. The one thing I will say about people who live in Whitefish is that they care a lot. About the resort and how it's run, about their city council, about what downtown looks like, about what the new Safeway will look like, about everything. There is a lot of controversy over these things, but that's because they are so important to people. At the end of the day, this is one of the friendliest places I've ever been. Red Lodge is the only place friendlier I can think of, and it's over the top there. Like walking into the filming of the Stepford Wives or something. 

3. We have always been a skiers' hill, and that's what we'll continue to work at. Yes, we occasionally sell some real estate to make ends meet, but that has never been the center of what we do, and it isn't now. Every complaint we get freaks us out and makes us wonder what solutions we can find. Every compliment we get makes us feel all warm and fuzzy inside. It doesn't matter if these are from some guy who owns a big townhouse on Sunrise Ridge or some guy who just drove his '92 Chevy up to make a few runs and eat his sack lunch. It's crazy, I know, but we really just want people to come here and have fun, no matter who they are. That's the driving force of everything we do. Oh, and we like to take ski breaks.

Anyway, if you read this whole thing, you're a more patient man (or woman) than I, but kudos, and I hope you feel better about things. Seriously, if you ever have an experience here that's something other than a laid-back blast, let us know, or at least leave your name when you post on internet bulletin boards.

As a skier, not an employee, I can honestly say that this is one of the best all-around places I've ever skied. I thought that when I was just learning, and I think that now that I'm totally awesome. 

That is all.

P.S. (You'll have to excuse me for the conflict of interest, but I am required to rate my own resort to post here, so rate I have. You'll notice that I have given Terrain Park and Apres Ski 4s, not 5s. That's because we all think our terrain park can get even better, even thought it's totally sick, and because we lost one great apres ski bar this year when they were forced to close the Alpinglow for structural reasons.)"
On the Snow,Whitefish,9th January 2008,positive,5,"Having lived in The Flathead Valley my whole life and skied Big Mountain almost all of my life the change the mountain has taken has been dramatic. The mountain is no longer a place for people ski, but a place for the rich who buy condos and hangout in the day lodge and maybe take a ski run. the things that have stayed the same however is the fog, heavy snow, not very many big dumps, and the fact that Whitefish is probably the most stuck up town in Montana.  "
On the Snow,Whitefish,8th January 2008,positive,4,"So far, not much fog this year. All snow. Fog is good, anyhow, it means I can find soft, uncrusted, unskied powder, inbounds, 5 days after a dump.

What ski towns have you been to that would possibly make Whitefish seem stuck up by comparison? It's one of the most laid back places I've ever been, ski town or not, and that's what I like about it.

The only other thing I have to speak to is the ""concrete"" snow. Are we talking about the same place? This year in particular, the snow has been spectacular. Like, freaking amazing. Chest deep over the Christmas Holidays. Wow.

Love, 

Howard."
On the Snow,Whitefish,8th January 2008,positive,5,"This mountain sucks. The mountian is always socked in with fog and when it snows it's like skiing on wet concrete. Also the lifties do not speak English. On top of that parking is horrible, and if your not there early there is up to a mile walk to the lift. The main lift is new and the way the lines are set up they are backed up onto the ski runs.  On the bright side however Big Mountain has new and improved name which is the name of the stuck up town below instead of the mountain. It is better to stay home and ski your own local hill.   "
On the Snow,Whitefish,6th January 2008,negative,1,"It's called Big Mtn for a reason, it's BIG.  So far this year it's also deep.  I haven't skied here long so I cannot fairly compare Whitefish management to Big Mtn management, but contrary to what Dec. 31 Anonymous says I am pretty sure that the did not mellow the terrain.  For the local haters, try to remember that they changed the name of the resort not the mountain.  Check out a USGS map, it's still called Big Mountain, always will be.  As long as the good Lord keeps us in the fog, try as they may, the Big will never become another Aspen.  Still big, still deep, still hometown friendly.  So please come out, have fun, go home and tell 10 friends it sucked, they should go somewhere else.  "
On the Snow,Whitefish,5th January 2008,positive,5,"Back when it was The Big Mountain it was a fun friendly place to ski.  Now it is ""Whitefish"" mountain, a real estate venture.  Pricey, snobby, and intermediate ski terrain.  Not a real Montana experience. Try Blacktail Mountain if you want some fun."
On the Snow,Whitefish,31st December 2007,negative,2,My gosh this place is amazing. I've never skied snow like I skied this week here. And the people are so friendly.

On the Snow,Whitefish,26th December 2007,negative,2,"YES it is called BIG FOG MOUNTAIN FOR A REASON. The fog can stop you dead in your tracks!!! But when you get one of those clear days, the skiing, snowboarding and views are second to none!!!! The lodging is good and has good access to the lifts and a shuttle to take you were you need to go. There is also a free snow bus from whitefish that is convenient and has a fairly good schedule to and from the resort. The nightlife on the mountain is slim to none with the beerstube bar being the highlight. But if you‚Äôre looking for live music, whitefish has some music but the quality of bands has really taken a hit with the Great Northern booking low quality cheep acts. About a year or so ago, the local bands they were booking were excellent! But the all mighty dollar has taken its toll. DO YOU HERE THAT DOUG (owner of the Great Northern)!!!!!!!!!!"
On the Snow,Whitefish,27th November 2007,positive,4,"Big Mountain is usually free of crowds--especially during the weekdays.   The skiing is quality stuff--during the heart of the season--BUT the south facing slopes in thr spring (March and April) get icy at night and slushy during the day.
One other caution--The local's nickname for the Mtn is ""Big Fog""--There are many days where you can't see you hand in front of your face--so check out the conditions before driving up the winding 7 mile road.
Nothing to do in the ""vilage"" at night but the great town of whitefish is only 15 minutes away by car and lots to do there."
On the Snow,Whitefish,30th May 2007,negative,3,"We found our mountain approx, 8 years ago on a last minute deal.  Our hotel named on arrival, turned out to be Grouse Mountain Lodge, probably the nicest hotel in our opinion, though there are many good ones.  First time we'd been to USA, previous two years Banff, otherwise Europe. Two weeks and we're hooked!  Return the following two years, staying at the Grouse.  Following year buying a home at Ptarmigan Village.  The mountain is beautiful, approx 4000 acres, stunning views, good runs catering for all. You want Powder there's lots of it!  See the Snow Ghosts!  Over the years we've seen a lot of development some good, some not so good.  Locals will tell you, ' they are trying to make it another Aspen', we hope not, though nothing against Aspen. We just fell 'in love' with the mountain, at any time of year, generally trying to make at least 2/3 visits per year.  This snow we're going for 3 months ski, how lucky are we! Whitefish is a quaint town, approx 6mls from ski village, free snowbus, couldn't wish for more, restaurants, bars, shops, everything you need and probably the nicest friendliest  people ever.  We can't wait to get back there, home!"
On the Snow,Whitefish,17th November 2006,positive,4,"My family and I have skied everywhere in Colorado and wanted something different, so we tried Whitefish. We won‚Äôt go back. It‚Äôs bone-chilling cold and cloudy/gloomy ‚Äî the locals said sunny days are rare. The mountain is small and gets crowded, especially on the groomers ‚Äî correction: on the groomed portions of runs, since most of the runs seemed to have moguls (which you can‚Äôt see in the flat gloomy light). The village is nonexistent so you have to drive into town or even into Kalispell if you need something or want to do something other than ski. We felt like we did the same few runs over and over. The kids (ages 4-16) were bored and cranky. Getting there isn‚Äôt hard but it isn‚Äôt easy. Overall, not worth it ‚Äî we won‚Äôt be back! "
On the Snow,Whitefish,21st September 2020,negative,1,We snowboarded at night on Feb 16/ 2020 and during the day on the 17th. Lots of fresh snow and the condition was great both during the day and night! 
On the Snow,Whitefish,21st February 2020,positive,5,"So far I have skied three of four of my planned days‚Ä¶ All exceptional skiing days! The snow is much better than the snow reports, powder everywhere, some ungroomed runs with fairly deep powder. Yesterday (Saturday) Lift lines were non-existent, skied into the lift every time."
On the Snow,Whitefish,5th January 2020,positive,5,"Lines tend be non existent here, lift tickets and housing are affordable and the terrain is as good as any mountain in the country.  It‚Äôs clear that the original layout of the mountain lift system was not well though out 50 years ago.  However, we‚Äôve been coming here for more than fifteen years and have witnessed great upgrades to the mountain lift system by current ownership. I also hear there are many more upgrades in process. The addition of the flower point chair and moving chair 5 to the east rim area were huge improvements. Thank you!  I‚Äôve heard of upgrades to the Hellfire area and I hope they are considering upgrades to the right side (as you look up the mountain from the bottom) of the mountain as well.  Russ‚Äôs street might be the longest catwalk in the country so I‚Äôm hoping they find a way to reduce that trek by providing lift service to the top from that side of the mountain.  The fog can quite bad here but tree skiing helps and there are plenty of gladed areas around Flower Point.  You can‚Äôt beat the lodging prices at the mountain. They are a fraction of what you might pay in Colorado.  There‚Äôs not much by the mountain at night besides a small bar at the base lodge and Ed and Mully‚Äôs at the bottom of chair three.  The town has several great restaurants but it is a good 15 minute drive away. overall, we love this mountain and look forward to seeing the new upgrades.  It has its trade offs but the pros far outweigh the cons. "
On the Snow,Whitefish,5th January 2020,positive,5,The people and town are beautiful. The snow is light and fluffy and the only downside is it is missing expert terrain. Great fun otherwise for the whole family. 
On the Snow,Whitefish,28th December 2019,positive,5,"Great local resort with plenty of terrain and very short lift lines. Fly into town via Alaska Airlines and ski for free on the day of departure.

On the Snow,Snowbowl,2nd January 2020,negative,3,"I learned to ski here.  It‚Äôs hard on a new skier, but if you make it through you ski for life.  This is home to me so I love it.  My daughter learned here.  Just come, have a relaxed mom and pop Montana ski hill attitude and you‚Äôll love it."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,14th May 2019,positive,5,"The road up is not as bad as people will lead you to believe. Just go a little slower and pull over to let people pass if you need to, no biggie. 

When this mountain gets snow, oh man is it good. I've had several days where I should have brought a snorkel. I cry myself to sleep nightly at the thought of all the amazing pow-plastered selfies I could have had if I had only grown my beard sooner. The tree skiing and ""freestyle"" terrain you can get into up here is pretty intense. 

The problem is that this mountain does not always have the snow. If it's been a while since the last storm rock skis are going to be a must. The summit is generally better than the base, like every mountain on earth, but even the bottom of the top lift turns into gravel pretty quickly. 

The bowl run-out is also lacking, as it is a steep ravine. I'm in pretty decent shape and have been skiing most of my life, but I dread coming out of the bottom of the bowls. 

This mountain is not for you if you are not a confident skier or are a beginner. While there are easier runs, you will get much better value out of a mountain like Discovery or Blacktail. 

The bar at the bottom makes some of the best pizza I've ever had in my life, and even if you don't ski (or mountain bike in the summer) I recommend you come and enjoy the food if nothing else. 

Overall this is one of my favorite mountains just because it has this charm to it, and also those pow face-shots I missed out on."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,18th January 2019,positive,4,"All around a really good mountain, will be five stars when the finally open up the new lift and runs.

On the Snow,Snowbowl,6th February 2016,positive,4,"it would be great if the lifts turned faster and didn't break down on a regular basis 

Th terrain I hard to beat though."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,23rd January 2016,negative,3,"Disclaimer: Skiers may love this mountain far more than snowboarders. This is an excellent mountain with some serious problems of execution. When visiting snowbowl I would always be suspicious of their snow report. If you are a park person, I'm sorry, the website will continue to tell you there is a park when in fact the park is seemingly always closed. Even if you call and ask if it's open, and they say yes, you will get there to find it closed. Couldn't tell you why. 

Similarly, I have often found that they are only running one lift, with no good explanation why. The only place I've ever seen shut down a lift for wind in 15 mph winds. On a mountain.

For snowboarders: you are required to have a leash on your board. They won't tell you that until you get to the front of the - often long - lift line. You know, in case your foot completely disengages from your leg, which happens all the time. Nevermind all those ski ejections - those pose no real threat.

Now, on the plus side, the mountain itself is great. Great terrain, very easily accessed by well placed (if a little slow) lifts. Nice long runs, AMAZING sustained steeps and trees galore. When it gets the snow it's a blast. 

It's just my experience there has always been lacking. The staff are almost uniformly rude, as if it was part of their training. The drive up is truly a nightmare, at the end of which you find yourself parking on the side of the road 1/2 a mile from the lodge. Driving down is even worse.

To sum up, the fantastic terrain of this mountain manages to negate a seemingly endless list of reasons NOT to go to snowbowl. "
On the Snow,Snowbowl,25th February 2014,negative,3,"Snowbowl is a great place to ski, right next to Missoula.  I've been up 5 times already this year and the only time i have noticed a liftie being a ""Douche"" (as per previous review)  Is when someone is clearly being an idiot, and or rude to other snowbowlers.   They will slow the lift down so really little kids can get on safely, and on snow days they do their best to get as much snow off your seat before you sit down as possible. the only conversations i've had with lifties ended with a smile.
The owners are cool too, they just dropped a TON of money into improving the access road to snowbowl.

As far as the mountain itself goes, it's probably not a place for beginners, some of the stuff snowbowl labels as blue runs would be considered black diamonds at other rocky mountain ski areas.  some of the stuff Snowbowl lists as black diamonds would be either double black or ""out of bounds"" at other places.   If you know what your doing on skis or a board this is a fun mountain, if not i imagine a vast majority of the mountain would be well beyond your skill level.

Lift tickets are reasonable ($42), -- the lifts are a little old and a little slow, but seem to be maintained well (although i hear rumors of them going down every now and again) and the bar at the bottom of the hill has regular bar prices instead of ski resort prices, great brick oven pizza and plenty of beer to choose from."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,14th January 2012,positive,5,MT Snowbowl is a real skiers lost paradice. The terrain is steep deep and epic tree skiing. Great BC access for good snow any time of the year. I you want to see people that rip the whole mtn. and dont complain about weather and conditions this is the place. The two slow old dubble riblets chairs add to the charm and give your legs a well deserved break from shredding 2600 feet of vertical sick terrain. The bar at the bottom has the best wood stove cooked pizza you will find any were and a great seltion of beers on tap.  The locals and liftys are some of the coolest people you will find any ski area. dont let this mtn pass you up.
On the Snow,Snowbowl,23rd March 2010,positive,5,"Well...Snowboal is a GREAT mountain if you like steep deep tree skiing.  The bar at the base of the hill, ""Last Run Inn"" is a classic mountain bar with some of the best wood stove pizza's I have had.  Great place to meet great local missoulians!  I have been to most mountainsd in the US and overall I put the Bowl in my top 5 for great powder turns, always untouched lines(if you know where your going), and great local people to hang with.  This is Montana in a nutshell for me!  Warning:   This mountain is not for the timid....if you are not an expert skier...try Lost Trail."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,8th December 2009,positive,5,"Snowbowl gets good consistent snow every year, but the southern exposure and low base elevation can make for variable conditions in the early season and spring.  Its close proximity to Missoula and the U of MT means crowded powder days, but the nightlife in Missoula makes it a good trade off."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,2nd December 2008,negative,3,"Snowbowl unfortunately only has two actual chair lifts with two more of the T lines. It's fun but the terrain is very limited and doesn't offer much diversity to skiers that are just starting out. Easy to see in a day, and fortunately doesn't yet have the big resort influence and prices (I paid 6 bucks for two slices of Pizza and a Drink) which is definitely a plus. I worked at Park City Mountain Resort and with a fifty percent discount on food couldn't get pizza that cheap, I was stoked, usually I have to take a backpack full of food (do it for the bigger resorts prices are ridiculous on food). It was overall a good experience, not really for beginners but if your an intermediate or expert skier the bowls just to the right of the second lift are pretty fun. Be ready for moguls and the most old school chair lift I've ever seen. "
On the Snow,Snowbowl,4th February 2008,negative,3,"Here is what the bowl is:
- The only ski area for folks from Missoula to ski w/o driving 150 miles round trip.
- A nice local area with a lot of terrain and vertical drop, as well as some of the best tree skiing around.  Seriously.  
- Two major storm tracks affect the area from the Pacific and unfortunately for the Bowl the storms mostly go south to the Bitterroot range or north to the Glacier park area.  
- Also unfortunately the majority of the mountain and all of the black runs face either due south or southwest (worst).  Especially in the beginning and ending of season the snow can be AWFUL.  (But with this said the snow can also be GREAT at anytime)
- There is some good hiking access from the area allowing good snow to be found almost anytime.  
- I skied here for 7 years and loved it.  This mountain breeds REAL skiers, you know, the ones who rip and don't bitch about conditions.  

Oh, and here is what the Bowl is not:
- A resort."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,27th January 2008,positive,4,"NOT a mountain for beginners.The green run from the first chair is only 12' wide.It
was a REAL DRAG!On skis its easy just snowplow or rip on blues and blacks.For a
beginning snowboarder its a nightmare.Riding down an old jeeptrail is NOT a true
resort experience so beginners other alternative are the ropetow or be ready to do alot of backside and frontside slides,crashs etc. to keep from flying into roadside trees.
For me it was my first chair run downhill on a snowboard.One I'll soon forget."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,7th January 2008,negative,1,"SnowBowl is wonderful on a powder day (but only for that day, once the sun comes out it is either slush or ice because most of the good runs are South facing.  Walk to the lifts and lodge for the first and last 3 weeks of the season because of low elevation and no snow at the base.  Other than unfriendly staff it is a great place and close to town.  I love it on powder days."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,3rd January 2008,negative,3,"Overall a fantasitc place to ski.  Friendly atmosphere, great terrain/vertical, quality food and convenient to town.  Since it is 200 miles roundtrip to any other local area from Missoula, I'll save the money on gas and spend the difference on the fantastic pizza, spend more time skiing and less time driving!"
On the Snow,Snowbowl,13th December 2007,positive,5,"First what I like, Snowbowl has the best out of bounds skiing/snowboarding in bounds.  You can always find good snow, if you look in the right places.  And they have excellent food at the lodge.  I was going to write a harsh review, but then checked ticket prices to be fair, because that is my biggest problem with Snowbowl.  They dropped ticket prices since I last checked, from the mid or high $40's to $36, which is acceptable for the mountain, as they have no good jumps or jibs for the park rat I became living by Tahoe.  They also need high speed lifts, other than that not a bad place."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,29th November 2007,positive,4,"Snowbowl is wonderful when it gets snow, and this year is looking good.  It's not really a beginner mountain, but does offer excellent terrain for intermediate and expert.  They shouldn't advertise they have a terrain park.  The staff isn't the best and is probably the only negative aspect of the whole experience.  They should charge less or be a little nicer to their customers. They do have the best pizza I've ever had, and a great bloody mary."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,29th November 2007,negative,3,"The ""Bowl"" as the locals refer to it is definitely not overpriced...who can complain about less than $50 lift tickets?

It‚Äôs detractions are a dominance of steep terrain, poor grooming and a local city of students, trust funders and seasonal workers who can show up for first chair on powder days.  This area needs a sugar daddy to buy a parking structure, a transportation system, a carpet to the lift, a beginner area, acres of glading and a bunch of groomers.

On the Snow,Bridger,12th February 2018,positive,5,"Great Mtn, but everybody knows that, crowds on the weekends and tracked out pretty quickly.  Still can find some fluff after a storm if you search the nooks and crannies though."
On the Snow,Bridger,1st February 2018,positive,4,"Otherwise: terrain parks so well maintained, so many features in them now.  You know that patrollers have our backs. We took ski lessons; very friendly,helpful office staff.  Dropped goggles, were recovered @ L & F, whew!  Still the best beer battered fries in the state served by fun cook/ servers @ DP Chalet. Overall seem like really good staff this year, especially ski shop, they really care. Of course, appreciate the affordability & eco-valet service via bus. (No, not summer!)  Polished systems, ata boy/girl!
Thx. Y'all!"

On the Snow,Bridger,28th October 2016,positive,4,love the place terrain 
On the Snow,Bridger,10th December 2014,positive,5,"Bridger Bowl gets some of the deepest, lightest snow anywhere in the Rockies.  The terrain off of the top of the mountain is as technical and steep as you like, although you only get about 1000 vertical feet before you are back in the lower mountain terrain.  You also need an avalanche transceiver to access the ridge terrain at the top.  A shovel, probe, and knowledgeable partner are also highly recommended.  Although this might seem excessive, one hike to the ridge or ride up the Slushman's lift, and you will see why this is important.  It is very easy to get cliffed out or find yourself in over your head (sometimes in powder!).  

There have been 4 new lifts put in since 2008, most notably the Slushman's lift, which you need a transceiver just to ride, as well as the new Bridger triple lift installed in 2010 (replacing an old double from the 60's), and 2 new brand new triple lifts in 2013 (replacing another aging double), providing better access to beginner and intermediate terrain on the North side of the ski area.  

The beginner lift in the base area currently serves a very small area and can become congested on busy days.  For this reason, I don't think Bridger is always ideal for folks who have never skied at all, although there are plans to expand the beginner terrain in the base area in the near future.  If you have the skill to ride up the quad lift out of the base area, the new lifts to the North provide lots of great beginner and intermediate terrain.  

The big powder days can be hectic with so many rippers eager to get first tracks, so get there an hour before opening if you want fresh tracks, and don't be surprised when the lower mountain is pretty tracked up by noon.  The parking is also limited on these huge powder days.  Once the crowd disperses on the upper mountain, you will be hard pressed to find a significant wait in any line, with the exception of the Slushman's lift, which can have a line up to 45 minutes long on powder days.  On off days, there are really no lines anywhere, and stashes of untracked snow can be found several days after the last storm.  

Overall, Bridger Bowl is an amazing deal with a day ticket around 50 bucks, a great ski/snowboard school, a positive vibe, beautiful and challenging terrain, and decent food and drink.  Only about 20 minutes from accommodations in Bozeman, it's pretty darn convenient considering that there is no lodging on the mountain (except for a few privately owned vacation rentals).  This also means you shouldn't expect much night life after 6pm on the mountain, you'll need to rely on downtown Bozeman for that.  "
On the Snow,Bridger,10th January 2014,positive,5,"I love Bridger!  I've been there twice before and am going again soon!  The chill atmosphere and no frills amenities at the bottom could be seen as a negative by some, but I love the cheap prices and easy going vibe.  The terrain has some good variety but the runs can feel limited if you are only skiing at the top parts of the mountain.  This shortens the runs and makes you feel like you are doing laps more than some other resorts.

With less traffic than other areas, it's easy to catch the snow when it drops.  There are rarely any lines and limited traffic on the mountain.

But if Bridger keeps offering awesome deals, we'll keep going back!"
On the Snow,Bridger,9th January 2014,positive,5,"Bridger Bowl is one of the best ski resorts I have ever been to. It's small compared to other skiing options in the Rocky Mountains but the staff and management at Bridger Bowl make up for it by offering an environment suitable for both experts and beginners in both skiing and snowboarding. The one mountain resort offers all examples of terrain varying from green groomers to double black diamonds. Bridger Bowl is a great environment for skiing with the family or  challenging your friends on the mogul fields in the ""bowl"" of the resort. I have been going to Bridger Bowl for four years now and although there is no on resort living accommodations it is worth the trip. The tickets are considerably cheap compared to other resorts in Montana allowing a family of four full day passes for roughly $150 and the lift lines are never crowded. During the season you can expect a descent amount of powder on the trails so beware if the wind picks up, their logo isn't ""Ski the cold smoke"" for nothing. Over all though, a little snow and wind shouldn't keep you from enjoying your time at Bridger Bowl and I'm looking forward to heading back up there next year. "
On the Snow,Bridger,9th January 2014,positive,4,"Bridger Bowl is a great place that is keeping skiing going for the average person.  It seems to be run very efficiently and smoothly.  People are very friendly and helpful.  Even had some mountain hosts on skis offer to show us great places to start based on our ability.  4 new lifts.  We also worked with a ski tech on our son's bindings who kept slipping with 2 hours left in the day.  He provided bindings, mounted them all free of charge and provided sound technical advice for fixing the problem."
On the Snow,Bridger,28th December 2013,positive,5,"deep pow, no lines,  technical skiing, short drivenothing!"
On the Snow,Bridger,18th December 2013,positive,5,"Bridger, near Bozeman, MT, is a community owned ski hill. That alone eliminates a majority of the destination resort crowd. Bridger is definitely a skiers mountain. I put five stars in family friendly however, because every kid you see up there looks like they can ski better than you, and they probably do.
What Bridger lacks in high speed lifts, they make up for in terrain. Bridger's renowned ridge, accessed via Bridger lift or the new Schlassman's lift has some legendary terrain. Chutes, cliffs, trees, powder stashes, hidden gulleys; Bridger is up to their balls in steeps, and in snow. The legendary coldsmoke that characterizes Bridger's winters contains 1-5% water, very dry, champagne status snow. The new lift opened last season, Schlassman's, opens up serious terrain that used to take hours to hike to. With this serious terrain comes the requirements for an avalanche beacon to ride. This helps keep it segregated from those that might accidentally happen upon terrain they can't handle, but it also keeps it out of reach for poor college kids, namely me. Beacon's run between 150-300 dollars, and they recommend a shovel and probe in the backcountry as well. This adds to your backcountry costs by about 100 dollars.
Don't let that tear you from Bridger however, the inbounds terrain is still some of my favorite in Montana. The trees off Alpine lift and Pierre's Knob leave little to be desired, especially since they're accompanied by hidden stashes of powder. Bridger's also relatively cheap (compared to Big Sky or Moonlight, about 50 miles away), and provides a relaxed atmosphere conducive to drinking a beer and hitting the slopes.

Watch out for rocks on exposed days, because, like other resorts in Montana, they seem to breed like rabbits. Go to Bridger if you love to ski. Go to Moonlight if you love hot tubs."
On the Snow,Bridger,30th March 2010,positive,4,"While certainly not the most vast resort in MT, Bridger Bowl benefits from a good location, and great snowfall. It also offers short, but challenging technical terrain as you get closer to the ridgeline, which is mostly accessible only if you're properly equipped with a transceiver. After a long day traversing from one glade entrance to another, you'll be happy to find Montana's closest equivalent to a city in nearby Bozeman, where you can enjoy a nice meal and some drinks downtown."
On the Snow,Bridger,24th March 2010,positive,4,"I spent an entire week at Bridger and simply loved it.  I found its trails to be well laid out, with very few cat-walks or having to walk far.   I took an intermediate group lesion that was just me and my buddy because there were so few people there. I also found the instructor friendly and helpful.  The lodges were nice, and everything (including the beer) was reasonably prices for a resort. 

They also have great multi-day packages that are a steal.

Everything I look for in a fantastic resort was at Bridger Bowl."
On the Snow,Bridger,3rd February 2010,positive,5,"Bridger Bowl is the quintisential gem in the rough. This is definately a local hill, and it caters to people who love to go big and have fun but could definately pass on the leather couches and 5 martini lunches in some five star restaurant. Bridger has absolutely fantastic advanced terrain and great expert terrain for those who would be willing to hike the ridge. The only problem is that they require you to have an avalanche transciever, even though it's only about 500' from the top of the lift to the top of the ridge. You can rent one, but I was cheap. I should have splurged because the pickings up there looked pretty darn good. However, you will find no shortage of lift served challenges here. The only major downside to this place other than its lack of ammenities (for those who need em), is the terrain park, which is next to nonesistant. However, since the whole mountain is essentially a huge terrain park, you won't necessarilly be wanting for air. Go jump off some rocks, because there are plenty with nice pillowy soft powder landings. This mountain is definately best for young 20somethings who want to hit it big and go party in a collge town after its all said and done.

However, if you are a flatlander looking for a family vacation, you might want to go with Big Sky. "

Community owned and located a half hour from downtown Bozeman, Montana; Bridger Bowl is a Rocky Mountain Classic. Bridger is characterized by a devoted core of locals, cold smoke Montana powder, and terrain rich with granite features, hidden stashes, steep trees and lots of nooks and crannies. 2009 marks a historic year for Bridger Bowl with the first lift served expansion in 30 years. The Schlasman chairlift opens a new world of terrain opportunities.

In addition to the new lift all the boundaries at Bridger opened up. Bridger used to be the little mountain that skied big. Now with the Schlasman lift and the open boundaries Bridger just got huge. Bridger Bowl is excellent at promoting avalanche awareness, safety and research and has one of the most respected ski patrols. Bridger‚Äôs lift tickets and season passes are a great value and it lacks the ritzy on-hill development that can sap the soul out of an area"
On the Snow,Bridger,15th February 2009,positive,5,"This is a true, hardcore skiers resort. It has chutes, cliffs, steeps, deep pow... everything you could want. No terrain park though. And you need an avalanche transceiver (beacon) to be able to ski the real gnar up on the Ridge and the new Schlasman lift. But that's what I mean by a ""true skiers"" resort. If you don't mind old, slow lifts and having to do short hikes to get the goods - my pompous definition of a ""true skier"" :P - then BB is the place for you. The new Schlasman terrain is sicker than anything at Jackson Hole, and a ticket here only costs $45!! BB is a nice little community resort used by local families and college kids. There are very few amenities and no pretensions. And that's what is so awesome about it. No posh lodges, no rich JONGs... just good skiing. I've been riding here for six years now, and I still love it. Even more now that the new lift is in. :) Check it out!!

I'll warn again: There is really nothing to do here except ski. It's close to Bozeman though - 20mins - and Bozeman is sweet, but the base area is scant. No hotels or condos. If you want hot tubs and massages, go to Big Sky or something. Bridger Bowl is just for riding."
On the Snow,Bridger,3rd February 2009,positive,5,"Visited Bridger just before Christmas and there were no crowds at all and the snow was terrific (best in Montana). The terrain is varied with something for everyone. The new Schlasman lift is wonderful. Accurately report snowfall and base depths unlike many Montana ski areas which just make it up. Nightlife at the hill is lacking, but Bozeman is close with plenty of options there."

if youve come to eat and drink,be catered to,look good, or just be annoy the locals wth your top of the line gear, this isnt the place to come. if you came to ski and dont care what others think well then come up and see what skiing is suppossed to be about. oh yeah and i hope you like hiking "
On the Snow,Bridger,22nd December 2008,negative,3,"Bridger Bowl is what skiing/snowboarding is all about. If you are looking for a knock down drag out day on the mountain this is your place. There is a vast amount of space to utilize and there is always a lot of snow. The mountain is set up to where the beginner runs are seperated from advanced ones. (The beginner runs are all at the bottom) You can hike the ridge and enjoy some back country skiing if you have what is required. ALL of the profits go back into the mountain so tickets are cheap, lifts are always working, staff is friendly, and actualy the rentals are pretty good. The 2008/2009 features the opening more terrain as well.  I have been to Big Sky and honestly put it behind Bridger simply because this place always seems to have better snow, the prices are drastically better, and it is closer to Bozeman.  (Which is a great town with good people and a lot of fun. The main reason I gave this place a 4 star for nightlife) Give it a shot and experience what everyone at Big Sky is missing."
On the Snow,Bridger,11th December 2008,positive,5,"Bridger is a medium sized area with great steeps and chutes on the upper mountain and lots of long intermediate terrain on the lower mountain. The top 1/3 is frequented by probably the highest percentage of outstanding skiers of any resort in the nation. The lower mountain has families, little kids, tourists, and some wanna-be park rats that haven't yet realized that Bridger has a crappy terrain park. Why create fake terrain down on the flats when there is awesome natural terrain?  Bridger has lots of locals who work all summer to be able to ski all winter, day in day out. And big powder days are crowded. Best skiing is mid-week. Only two bars at the base, basically shut down by 6:00, and no lodging. But college-town Bozeman has lots of night life 15 minutes away."
On the Snow,Bridger,21st March 2008,positive,4,"good place to stand in line or hike with the entire population of gallatin county on a powder day.  lots of ""locals"" and trust fund babies from kentucky.  too bad its not located by great falls intead of bozangeles."
On the Snow,Bridger,8th February 2008,negative,3,Bridger Bowl is a nonprofit ski hill owned by the town of Bozemen.  It is a great value and a very fun place to ski. It has something for everyone.  It gets a ton of snow and there are lots of powder days.  There is not much of a terrain park.  All there is is like three box rails.  You can hike up to the ridge above the lifts to have some backcountry skiing if you have all the safty equiptment.  Overall its a great hill and I would definetly recomend it.
On the Snow,Bridger,22nd December 2007,positive,5,"Bridger is the way skiing was meant to be.  The non-profit resort has world class snow and terain, provides an honest snow report, and has a great family atmosphere.  I travel over 5000miles round trip each winter to experience great skiing without the glize and galmour of the touristy type places.  With the future expansion, it will rival any ski resort in North America."
On the Snow,Bridger,25th July 2007,positive,5,"For the money, can‚Äôt beat this place. Gets lots of cold smoke and powder. During the week, on most days, few people and real chilled atmosphere. Has a real community ski hill feel. "
On the Snow,Bridger,10th March 2020,positive,5,"Easy 25 minute ride from Bozeman , great dive bar located at bottom of mountain if you don't want to partake in the one's run by Bridger. Really no lift lines except once in awhile at one of the feeder lifts at the base and that is only when half day pricing starts .Expert and ridge runs are spot on as long as your hooked up with a transponder.  Lots to do in town ,always have a great time there !"
On the Snow,Bridger,22nd February 2020,positive,5,Great advanced terrain.  No lift lines.  5 dollar local pints all over the mountain.

  "
On the Snow,Bridger,27th January 2019,positive,5,"We probably picked a bad time to come. The crowds were insane. By early afternoon, the snow was starting to get packed and rutted.

On the Snow,Discovery,28th October 2020,positive,5,"Easy to get to nice large for family dining
Great to rain and beautiful views of Georgetown Lake"
On the Snow,Discovery,18th March 2020,positive,5,"Discovery is a wonderful small ski area run by folks who really know what they‚Äôre doing.  The result is fantastic grooming, lifts that run and the best food values of any Montana resort (check out the fresh rolls, cookies, soups, entrees).  The beginner area is perfect for kids and viewing parents.  There‚Äôs a full range of runs including a double-diamond backside for the deepest days and more steeply inclined.  The views from the ski hill Are a mini Lake Tahoe with the Pintler Wilderness Peaks surrounding Georgetown Lake,  The drive from the north through cowboy land is peaceful and spectacular.  Overall, a great experience if you stay local or drive remotely."
On the Snow,Discovery,2nd January 2020,positive,5,"This is a great local hill.  One of, if not, my favorite.  Three back side terrain is quite fun and you can find some technical terrain if you're looking.  However,  the runs are fairly short in comparison, especially on the steeper back side."
On the Snow,Discovery,10th December 2019,positive,5,"We‚Äôve skied western Montana for 30+ years and choose Disco as our favorite for size, variety of terrain from too easy to too hard, lack of crowds (even on busy weekends, skiers are well-dispersed and lines aren‚Äôt bad), and their affordable season passes.  And the scenery is great, too!"
On the Snow,Discovery,8th December 2019,positive,4,"There are more than a few resorts within a few hours drive that‚Äôd I‚Äôd rather go to for better terrain, snow, and apres ski. Not bad if you live in the area and are teaching kids to ski. Lift ticket are reasonable. Not many accommodations close by. The harder terrain is patchy with coverage. More of a groomer mountain."
On the Snow,Discovery,13th February 2018,negative,3,"Over 2000 acres of terrain, small local crowds, and cheap lift tickets make this one of the best family-friendly resorts you'll ever find. It may have THE BEST beginner to intermediate terrain of any resort in the Rockies.  Your beginners don't have to be relegated to the bottom third of the mountain like at other resorts and your experts will stay entertained on the backside which is nearly all double-black diamond.  The resort has a nice little day lodge with a decent grill and food selection and a picnic area downstairs where you can pack your own cooler.  This resort ""gets it"" when it comes to families.  Jackson Hole and Big Sky are great, but they aren't three-times better than Discovery.  If money is no object, by all means, choose one of those resorts.  But if you're looking for a great and affordable mountain to ski throughout the season, it's hard to beat Discovery."

On the Snow,Discovery,20th December 2014,positive,5,"What a great mountain! We are mostly intermediate and do not get board on this mountain though our steep and deep friends love the backside, we enjoy all the nice long cruising runs.
They are well maintained and the lifts are in very good shape. You cant beat the food in the charming rustic day lodge and prices are very reasonable. Its a 'no wonder' when I ride the lifts with people from Bozeman and other areas close to Big Sky that they come to this mountain. Great bang for the buck for a family - has kinder ski, bunny slope and a few nice greens for training the newbies. Views are spectacular of Georgetown Lake from the top. Plan to spend the night in Philipsburg and enjoy the brewpub for apres ski or get a free beverage with lift ticket at Sunshine Station. Food and wine list at Silver Mill are surprisingly good for this small town. "
On the Snow,Discovery,21st February 2014,positive,5,We skied all day Saturday and Sunday. My sweetheart is a XX black diamond guy...I am a whole lot weaker. We both had a great time. The instructors are great as well.
On the Snow,Discovery,21st February 2014,positive,5,"If you mission is to actually ski or snowboard and not whine about food service or a lack of after hours hook up activity -AKA- ""Nightlife"" then discovery is perfect. Disco is definitely is one of my favorite (actually, probably my favorite) mountains in Montana. In other words, no frills...but....terrain that truly spans from ""absolute beginner"" to ""absolute expert"". The staff is laid back and cool to say the least and ticket prices are waaay cheap....No pain in the a** tourists standing in the middle of the groomers and plenty of STEEEEP  challenging runs!"
On the Snow,Discovery,10th February 2012,positive,5,"Discovery is another hidden gem in Montana.  It has suffered from poor snow in recent years, but this spring is different.  When Disco finally gets snow (like it has past two weeks) it really comes into its own, with a great variety of terrain and a fairly efficient and decent lift system. There are runs for everyone.  Discovery is probably one of the top ski areas in the state to bring kids. (beats Whitefish is that category).  They even have a chair for the bunny slope.  No awful rope tow to deal with for pre-schoolers.  Great Kinder-ski program.  They spread the variety of terrain and slopes out very well, with each successive level of difficulty on a different area of the mountain and each served by its own lift.  The back side is true double black diamond.  The runs there are fairly short and they need good snow to cover all the rocks and debris, but once you have that snow--WOW, great skiing.  The best part of the mountain is the newer Granite Chair.  Great runs, powder, and best of all, the runs end up at the bottom of the chair, as opposed to the Limelight Chair where you end your run on a tedious serpentine trail or in a flat bumpy valley.  The backside also faces north so the snow stays longer and better.  Amazing views of Pintlers and Georgetown Lake add to the pleasure of this hill.  Another bonus is the price.  Lift tickets are very reasonable.  Food is great, although the one downside is that the cafeteria service is very slow.  They really haven't figured out how to handle any busy lunch crowd.  You don't go to Discovery for Apres-Ski.  There is NONE.  Parking could be better too, but that's small potatoes.  Try Disco out if the snow is good.  You'll be happy you did. "
On the Snow,Discovery,3rd April 2009,positive,4,"Good ski area when conditions are right. Fun terrain. Starting to get a bit more crowded on weekends. Avoid the cafeteria on weekends, one of the most inefficient operations I have ever seen. I'll agree the snow reports can exaggerate, but they have gotten better since the web cam was added. You need to watch the web cam carefully to know if the snow is swept daily. This week it was swept on Monday afternoon and never again for the week. So actual snowfall was about 2"", 1"", and 2"". Discovery reports the total accumulation as 2"", 3"" and 5"" 24 hour snowfalls over the next 3 days. Okay maybe a bit picky, but rushing up for 5"" of new snow and finding almost 2"" new can be a bit of a disappointment. Still skied good."
On the Snow,Discovery,27th March 2009,positive,4,"Ok, I usually ski in Colorado and was only at Discovery for one day so take this with a grain of salt.  It was a Wednesday two days after a 19"" dump.  In the middle of the day it dumped for about 1-1/2 hours leaving about 6"" of powder prior to clearing out.  The front was meticulously groomed with wide expanses of virgin courderoy.  The back was incredibly steep with interesting hucks and a consistently nice pitch.  You could flow effortless power turns with little effort on the steep terrain.  We found ourselves hitting Maverick with its deposited snow repeatedly.  The furthest bowl was more standard black diamond terrain with less pitch but still really nice.  There were very few people there.  I've skiied a ton of places and would place it in my top three of all time (other two = Grand Targhee and Wolf Creek).  Never hit the terrain park so can't comment on that but 7 Gables near Georgetown Lake had real good fried chicken!"
On the Snow,Discovery,26th March 2009,positive,5,"This ski resort is, I have to say, the best non-destination ski resort in Montana.  This ski resort has the best bunny hill for learners, some of the toughest terrain in the country, and next to no lines.  The best part is that the beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert lifts are all separate, so beginners have no way of going down the expert runs.  Also the expert runs at discovery can only be compared to going down Lone Peak at Big Sky.  Overall I'm going to have to say Discovery is the best small resort in Montana."
On the Snow,Discovery,29th December 2008,positive,5,"Discovery offers 5 lifts that all offer different terrain suited for anyone's ability.  The expert terrain on the backside is on par with most double-blacks offered at Big Sky or Bridger, and is better than anything you will find at Big Mountain or Snowbowl.  Discovery's backside offers less vertical than many ski hills, but there is no wasted space, and the life ride is short.  The poster who said base depths and snowfall are inaccurate could not be more wrong.  Discovery has a web cam that allows people to see how much snow they have received.  The snow is consistent, although huge storms are not common.  There are options for lodging not far from the ski hill, including several close to Georgetown Lake.  Discovery is the perfect place to bring the family without the cost and hype of Montana's bigger resorts.  The lunch counter needs improved so that people don't have to stand in line like cattle.  I usually avoid the cafeteria for this reason.  "
On the Snow,Discovery,27th December 2008,positive,5,"Discovery is overal a good place to go. The prices are good and it offers something for everyone with the exception of some extreme skiing you might get at Whitefish or Bridger. The backside is jam packed with double blacks and one blue square if you need to bail out. The main side is wide open and great for beginners. There was no terrain park when I went, however they offer one now. Not much of a nightlife unless you drive a distance to Butte or Anaconda."

Discovery is a regional ski area drawing people mostly from within 100 miles and there is no lodging or nightlife at the ski area, but a few places 5 miles away around Georgetown Lake. You must stay 20-25 minutes away in Philipsburg or Anaconda for most lodging and nightlife. Discovery lacks good consistent snowfall, but by February most runs are sufficiently covered, yet you should still beware of rocks on steeper runs. Do not bring your good skis before late January. Another reviewer noted that the snow reports are not accurate, this includes base depths that are exaggerated (divide by 2). "

A safe & low key beginner area with significantly long runs for new skiers. New skiers can gain confidence there without getting buzzed by lift-bound hotshots. A second set of lifts serves an adjacent peak with a nice mix of varying intermediate trails with some expert runs. I spent the whole day on that peak while my kids were learning over on the beginner hill. The bowl shape means that all runs on this side of the mountain converge to the same general area, so you can check in on the kids or do a run or two with them, or make a quick stop at the lodge, without backtracking all over the mountain as you see at some areas that have outgrown themselves and have runs in all directions. The backside (north) has some scary stuff that keeps the hotshots over there."
On the Snow,Discovery,24th January 2008,positive,4,"Some areas never tell the truth about snow conditions and Discovery is one of those, they'll tell you they have 6 new inches and you'll find a sciff when you show up.  Fun to ski if it is a true powder day, which they don't have many of.  Look up the weather report before going (don't believe Discovery's website)"
On the Snow,Discovery,3rd January 2008,negative,3,Awesome steeps on the backside. Great ski area where you can ride the lift with the owner of the area.  We have had season passes up there for a couple of years and it just gets better and more fun each time we go.  Discovery is the bomb!!!!!!!!
On the Snow,Discovery,8th December 2007,positive,5,"Discovery is Montana's hidden secret. Once the base is over 25"" it is heaven. If less than 25"" I don't go. This area has every kind of terrain from rank begnner to XX. When they say XX, believe it.

With fresh powder it is unbeatable. Lift tickets are affordable. The kids have their own program and also can roam the mountain. Don't worry they are being watched, and if they misbehave, it will be time out. The cafeteria has great food and if it is too pricey, bring your own. This is a resort built by skiers for skiers. No big corporate"" we only care about our profits"" mentality here.

If you are looking for apres ski, or looking pretty in front of the fireplace, don't Ski Discovery. If you want a great skiing experience that will chanllenge you. Discovery is for you. It is about a half hour's drive to Fairmont Hot Springs Resort where soaking in the naturally heated pool and watching snow flakes fall makes the evening."

On the Snow,Discovery,18th March 2020,positive,5,"Discovery is a wonderful small ski area run by folks who really know what they‚Äôre doing.  The result is fantastic grooming, lifts that run and the best food values of any Montana resort (check out the fresh rolls, cookies, soups, entrees).  The beginner area is perfect for kids and viewing parents.  There‚Äôs a full range of runs including a double-diamond backside for the deepest days and more steeply inclined.  The views from the ski hill Are a mini Lake Tahoe with the Pintler Wilderness Peaks surrounding Georgetown Lake,  The drive from the north through cowboy land is peaceful and spectacular.  Overall, a great experience if you stay local or drive remotely."
On the Snow,Discovery,2nd January 2020,positive,5,"This is a great local hill.  One of, if not, my favorite.  Three back side terrain is quite fun and you can find some technical terrain if you're looking.  However,  the runs are fairly short in comparison, especially on the steeper back side."

And the scenery is great, too!"

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I liked skiing at Aspen and Snowbird, with their 60 man tramway! It‚Äôs just a different experience and I love the townspeople at Red Lodge as well. Just normal folks, you probably won‚Äôt see the Kardashians there or Kanye and that suits me just fine. You can go to Jackson for that! "

I prefer boutique Western Ski resorts like Red Lodge, Monarch (Colorado), Bridger Bowl, and Snowdown with long vertical because of no crowds, no lines, friendly, Affordable, skiing without traffic, and no pomp and fashion show (just skiing).

If you like the hip fashion and pick-up Scene - then go elsewhere. "
On the Snow,Red Lodge,30th November 2019,positive,4,"Just got back from our 5th annual family trip to Red Lodge.  We keep coming back because we love the skiing, love the prices and it is the closest mountain skiing from Minnesota.  It is advertised as Montana skiing pure and simple.  Nothing fancy at all.  No lines, no attitudes and lots of common folks having fun skiing.  The parking lot is filled with pickup trucks and family vans. The best skiing and fastest lifts are on the Cole Creek side of the mountain.  My family loves this place! "
On the Snow,Red Lodge,12th March 2019,positive,5,Red Lodge is a true throwback classic-- great intermediate skiing and plenty of expert when snow is sufficient to open the drain and shales areas-- staff are wonderful friendly and helpful-- the  coal creek high speed quad provides more vertical than most skiers have legs to enjoy- want old school and soul of skiing check out Red Lodge
On the Snow,Red Lodge,1st February 2019,positive,5,The lift failures in the past couple years have many of my friends concerned about taking their kids up there. It seemed like we spent more time sitting on a dead lift this weekend than we did skiing.
On the Snow,Red Lodge,21st January 2019,negative,1,"I'm all about having fun on a mountain but I'm in my 30's now and that means I expect certain features. This place is okay if you're in a time crunch or can't travel very far from Billings, but other than that it isn't worth it. "
On the Snow,Red Lodge,16th November 2017,negative,1,"I hate to bash a ski resort, where I agree with the other reviewers ""everyone is very nice,"" but sadly that is where the compliments end for me.  They haven't built a new lift in 20 years it seems, the doubles + triples creep @ a snails pace.  The base area infrastructure needs an overhaul and a serious clean, the bathrooms are terrible.  I got food poisoning from the base area restaurant.  I recognize they can't help snow conditions, but they could at least do an average job of grooming what they have ....  for example one run was groomed for the first 200 yards (poorly), then left untouched for another 300 yards, then groomed the rest of the way down.  For a $55 lift ticket in MT, I'd ski Whitefish 10 out of 10 ten days.  You can also ski Mt Hood, Bridger Bowl, Grand Targhee or a handful of similarly sized resorts and have a far better day.  Until RML comes out of its time warp, I see no reason to come back."

On the Snow,Red Lodge,11th December 2016,positive,5,"Didn't have the best snow last year but still a blast to ski! Such a fun mountain with lots of terrain and friendly staff. This is just a real down to earth place, and often no lift lines. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."
On the Snow,Red Lodge,17th November 2016,positive,5,"It's been a rough snow year for Red Lodge Mountain, but they've been doing an amazing job with what they have. And you won't find a friendlier group of people, or more bang for you buck either.  "

On the Snow,Red Lodge,5th December 2014,positive,5,"I went to Red Lodge this last President's day weekend.  I really liked it.  My wife and I found the town to be charming and the people friendly.  Our bed and breakfast was fantastic.  The mountain itself offered varied terrain.  The prices were lower that what I had been paying in New England, and you can imagine that the scale of Red Lodge is grander than the eastern resorts.  The lack of lodging on the mountain is just fine by me, as that keeps the focus on the snow experience rather than a resort experience.  The only real gripe is the long drive to get there, but I live in the plains and you need alpine for alpine skiing."
On the Snow,Red Lodge,26th February 2012,positive,4,Red Lodge is a good resort with an affordable price their snowfall is unmatched this year although their customer service is terrible.
On the Snow,Red Lodge,16th January 2012,positive,5,"We drove out from Minneapolis over the Christmas week.  

This place has a monster rise off the local terrain.   We had stopped in Billings on the way out to buy discount lift tickets - adults at $42 rather than $49,  (college kids get them for $32 at the hill), and could see not only the hill but the runs from the edge of Billings - 50 miles away. The town of Red Lodge is at 5500 ft, the plains below probably at 4000 ft or less, so the view from the top was huge.  You could see the Crazy mountains and I'm quite sure the Bridger range to the west.  Behind were the peaks and high plateau of the bear tooth range - spectaular.  The ski hill peaks are at 9700, chalet base is 7700, but the palisade area drops another 400' for the advertised 2400' vert.   But the impressive part is it's 2000 ft straight down.   Two main runs run from top to bottom, one is black diamond (upper and lower limited), the other intermediate (lazy M) (but in the midwest it would also be black diamond).   All of us went down Lazy M, but it isn't lazy.   You wouldn't be able to bomb it - and the limited, which is groomed - would get you up around a hundred if you tucked and kept your feet.  That run, if left ungroomed would be a 2 mile mogul run all the way down.   Even the beginner lift, Miami beach, has a grade like an intermediate run and is tilted to the fall line, so isn't the best for beginners, but is a full 300 ft in elevation.  Our daughters spent much time on that run.  The only true beginner area is right out front the chalet in the wide ravine though which all the runs eventually funnel to the main lower lift.   The Miami beach area is in it's own side ravine.   The main area has a long magic carpet off the north side and a roped area for beginners and lessons.  Good area for true beginners.  It was packed.  
 
Five days before we arrived they got 2 feet of snow.  Three days before our arrival temps got up into the 40s.   We saw little powder, almost all hard packed power, and a touch of the hard stuff.  Conditions were actually very good and what we like to ski, but I was surprised it settled and got knocked down so fast.  This hill was completely open, base of 4' +, nothing else in the West as far as I know was even 75% open at this time, so folks normally running off to Big Sky for the day or Bridger were here.  The parking lot is small for ski area size and cars were parked on the side of the access road going a full mile down the road.  My wife had an old guy sit with her for a while and said normally the top lot is only half full.  Yet in spite of having record crowds, and mostly older lifts, there were no real lift lines.   Even on day 2 when they closed the upper lifts, my son and I took the willow lift multiple times - no lines.   An exception to this was the Miami beach lift which ran at a snails pace had a long line and the high speed quad in the palisades area had a bit of a line.   The main triple lift flies along, they have a sign in front telling you you'll get knocked on your can if you don't pay attention.  
 
My son and I skied much on the front side and Latigo in the Cole Creek area.  Again very steep grade for an intermediate run.   His gps showed a 1000+ ft drop in about a mile.   I skied true grit (double black) once - steep with mostly shallow bumps..And of course there was a family of 4 going down it - mom, dad, sister and little sister - about age 5.   Not sure what their motivation was - at their rate they were going to get just one run in.   Our second time down this area we took the trail that goes to the bottom of the palisades.  My son said it was the best trail he's ever been on.  Dangerous weaving thing, hard to keep the speed down.    Other great mogul runs were Berrys, Thompsons' and Royals run.   Even on the lower level of the hill off the side of the main ridge, they had runs like Bigfoot and Bear paw that longer bump runs than most in the Midwest.  
 
Best part of the hill is the terrain, from looking at google earth and the tail map, I underestimated the size and topography.   It's much larger, steeper, and varied than I expected.  Ridges, valleys and heavily treed.  Much more interesting terrain than Solitude and Winter Park, and from what I remember of Keystone and A-basin.   Similar but obviously smaller, yet more challenging than Snowmass.  The Drainage area looked cool from the chair but not like the map... it's just tree skiing in a really steep gorge.  I didn't try it.    
 
Short comings?  Lower parking is 50 ft below upper parking.  Upper parking is 20 ft below the chalet.   Step out of the undersized Chalet, and you have to walk up 12 ft of hill to get to either of the lift lines.   Had they not flattened out the area for the parking, they could have continued the runs down another 500 feet into the ravine.   They're short of flat areas.  Instead of fanning out onto flats, it all funnels in to a congested, overly steep area.  I didn't mind, nor did our kids, but not an easy place for beginners.   The upper chalet was very nice.   Day 2 we stopped in early - almost empty.  Next we stopped at noon, jam packed, but again the weather went from calm, sunny and 35 in the morning to maybe 40 mph gusts midday.  
 
The entire area is in a national forest with limited base facilities for the size of the hill.   Sort of like Lutsen on a busy day.  They did put in 2 high speed quads in sometime ago - for Cole creek and Palisades, but in my opinion they should have used the Palisade quad (not always in use) and used it to serve the base area, and moved dirt around to make base area more friendly.  Also there is no on site lodging so it's a ski hill - not a resort.  I imagine the locals would want it to stay the way forever.   Limited older lodging in town, inconvenient for beginners, no glamour.   In return they get great cheap skiing.    I'd go back for another look.   Can't say the same for three of the other places I've been to in the last few years.    "
On the Snow,Red Lodge,30th December 2011,positive,4,"Every since I started skiing, this has been my resort of choice.  It is very family oriented and you will enjoy it if you haven't skiing before or you are bring your family with you.  You also get beginning, intermediate, and expert level terrain for all ages.  It could be better, but I highly recommend it for first time skiers and boarders, as well as families."
On the Snow,Red Lodge,8th October 2011,positive,4," We were on our way to Big Sky but the interstate was closed due to snow so we had to detour to Red Lodge Mountain.  Skiing was excellent. People were friendly, Tickets were  about half  the price we are use to paying. There is no lodging on the mountain but our kids had a great time in town.  I can't wait to go back. We can ski Red Lodge for a week for what it cost 2 days at Big Sky and It's a lot more fun.   Oh ya the snow was awesome."
On the Snow,Red Lodge,28th November 2010,positive,5,"skied RL last sat and sun- cold as you know what but great skiing- two days of snow left 8-10 inches of new- not quite steamboat champagne but primo stuff for an early December weekend.  Sure, lifts are a little slow-no highspeed detachables,but a 47buck lift ticket is hard to beat!  Some nice bumps being built up on the upper lift- had sore quads for days after!  Don't know much about thier TP - not much of a pub crawler-just here for the snow."
On the Snow,Red Lodge,11th December 2009,positive,4,I am orginal from Montana and Red Lodge was my home town Mountain! Now I'm in PA and there is nothing compared to Red Lodges real snow (no ice!) and longer runs. Not to mention a great terrain park for Boarding !
On the Snow,Red Lodge,2nd December 2009,positive,5,This mountain is the worst mountain I could have ever immagined. The snow is not snow. It's ice. The help is annoying and not actually that helpful. Lifts are outdated and the Lodge is far too old (it feels like the floor is rotting). Even the food (never that good at a resort anyway) was just awful. The environment was definitely not child friendly. Way overpriced for what you get. I can tell you that I will *never* return to this mountain. I wouldn't care if it was the last place to board on earth.
On the Snow,Red Lodge,1st December 2009,negative,1,"I've skiied there for the first time last year. And I met two young men who work there as ski patrollers . I sparked up a conversation with them and told them I was a front range skiier from Colorado. And asked if there were good runs comprable to Summit Counties here? They looked at each other, nodded knowingly to themselves and took me skiing through the trees and glades way off to the skiers left. It was quiet, serene and beautiful and the snow was like butter. It was fantastic!  The open runs over there were also steep, narrow and excellent. I couldn't believe how uncrowded it was.And the Quad lift line was non-existant all day long. What a gem!

Later that year, during spring break it snowed an incredible amount (3 to 4 feet in 24 hours) and once I heard about that I drove like a madman from Bismarck, and rented an inexpensive hotel that was very nice. I think it was called The Chalet. And the next morning I drove up the accesss road to Red Lodge. But it was miserably slow from all the snow that had fallen. The road was littered with all types of front wheel and rear wheel drive vehicles spewn all over the road. But that didn't dampen my spirits. And that shouldn't dammpen your's either. We just have to leave earlier next time it snows. Alas, the snow fall was too much for the staff to handle that day.And the double black runs I  had skiied earlier that season wern't open. That was a fluke snow storm though. And no amount of help that day could have opened up those runs. 

But take it for what it's worth. Those two guys I met who worked for the ski patrol wern't lying when thay said to me ""This is the best skiing in Montana when we have snow"" and boy were they right. By all means go to Red Lodge. But mostly go to Red Lodge when it's snowing. You won't be dissapointed. And hopefully mother nature will cut you some slack!"
On the Snow,Red Lodge,10th November 2009,positive,4,"Red Lodge is my hometown resort so I may be a little byes but I love it. Cole Creek has awesome terrain and for mogul lovers there is plenty to play on. I get cheap college passes for 30 dollars, but I want to get a season pass; the problem is that there is no college season pass deal so I would have to go 14 times to make it worth it, its to risky since I am only home for breaks. I just love all the terrain at Red lodge, no cat tracks at the end of runs, you are taking 2 lifts strait to get to the top originally, but you can lap the grizzly once you get up there. 2nd street is right under grizzly so you can see people rip the moguls... or boo them when they squeegee it. Its an all around great place. I like the atmosphere for the most part; the only problem, and this is a big problem for me, is that I have experienced at least 3 angry liftees. Never in my life had I met an angry liftee until I went this year to red lodge. Lighten up Red Lodge liftees, you have a dream job!"
On the Snow,Red Lodge,7th April 2009,positive,5,"Wonderful  Place, Very Friendly, such a refreshing change from the over hyped, rediculously over priced Colorado resorts. We spent a week and got dumped on with more than 40 inches of snow in one week.  I have skied for 35 years and this was the best ski week ever."
On the Snow,Red Lodge,2nd April 2009,positive,5," If you are looking for a glitzy new ski area, keep driving. Red Lodge Mountain is an area with fair ticket prices, an old school chalet, and plenty of challenging terrain. The ski area people are friendly and the runs can be family friendly. My wife can ski the groomers while my son and I hit the more challenging runs and our secret stashes. We meet up at the lift and ride up together... quality time !

Both Grizzly Peak and Cole Creek provide excellent black diamond runs mixing glade's, bumps, and steeps.
For intermediate skiers and boarders, Lazy M is a cruising run dropping about 2,400 feet from the top of Grizzly down to the base. Lower on the mountain there are plenty of green runs for the less experienced, with blue's and a couple black's to keep it interesting.  Red Lodge seems to get it's best snow in the Spring as the late season storms push over the Beartooth Pass to dump fresh snow on the mountain.

The word on the street is RLM has added new snowmaking to help cover the early season rocks and has upgraded their lifts. 

After a day on the slopes the old western town of Red Lodge has a lot to offer. From an old fashioned candy store to the typical resort gift shops, strolling along Broadway helps you connect with the mountain town lifestyle. There is no shortage of good restaurants and bars either, with everything from fine dining to good pizza. And don't miss the locals favorite, the Red Lodge Ale tasting room, dogs and kids allowed. Just like the mountain, except for the dog part."
On the Snow,Red Lodge,9th November 2008,positive,5,"I just moved to Billings from the Vail Valley and I think RL is great when they have snow. I went in late March of 2008 when they had a series of dumps-the skiing was very good and pretty challenging. Contrasted to the other time I went during Jan when the skiing was pretty poor with nothing on Cole Creek open.

Cole Creek has tight steep glades and chutes and forces you to ski the fall line. RL lacks open bowls, and obviously the Palisades chair needs to be put at the base where it can do some good.

I liked the Bierstube as well-very friendly locals scene. The town is nice as well. The best thing about RL is it only an hour easy drive from Billings.

I am looking forward to next season. I was very pleasantly surprised!

On the Snow,Red Lodge,5th May 2008,positive,4,Very fun ski mountain. No lines and inexpensive!
On the Snow,Red Lodge,6th April 2008,positive,4,"""A diamond in the rough!""  No ski area I've been to better epitomizes this statement.  Skiing there at the end of March was great.  Yes, they had lift troubles but once new owners spend some money, I would expect this little mountain to go crazy.  Best thing about Red Lodge Mountain is the town of Red Lodge itself.  No other ski area in the Rockies has as much character without the pretense that comes with places like Vail, Aspen, Sun Valley or Jackson.
By the way, had an unbelievable dinner at ""Bridge Creek"" right downtown.  The locally-raised beef and fresh seafood blew us away and Peter, the owner, really knows his wines.  Don't tell him though, or he'll raise his unbelievably low prices.  Great skiing, great locals, great wine.  Need I say more?"
On the Snow,Red Lodge,2nd April 2008,positive,4,"I think maybe RLM should of put that Back 40 detatchable chair right in front of the Stube. When the Midway Express chair is down it really sucks to half to go all the way to the bottom and ride that 15 min. chair that all the dweebs ride just to get back to the Grizzly Peak chair. When I was there the week of 3/17/08 they had 6"" of new snow one day and 5"" the next and still never ran that Back 40 detatchable anyway. Never the less, don't tell anyone about RLM. It seems to be one of the last vestabules of sanity  in a ski world gone mad with greedy pig owners. "
On the Snow,Red Lodge,23rd March 2008,positive,4,"Wow how can I explain my most recent trip to the mountain.  Let's just say SCARY!!!  The best part was the moodlighting at the Bierstube (when the power was out)  The worst part was waiting over an HOUR to be rescued from the chairs, because the POWER went OUT!  There have been two times in my life when I have had to be rescued from a chair.  Unfortunatly BOTH times have been in Red Lodge.  Will I ever bring my self to go back?  Only time will tell.  That is the nice thing about time.  It does heal wounds.  The question is..... does Red Lodge have enough time for 'time' to heal this wound? I hope they discover the fountain of youth.... For Red Lodge's sake.....  "
On the Snow,Red Lodge,29th January 2008,negative,1,"I love Redlogde Mountain!  I have been riding for 15 years and my mom and dad would take me there when I was 5.  We have very good snowmaking equipment and I have seen a great improvment with the coverage of man-made snow.  I think those of us who love REAL snow should pray to the mountain gods that they dump on Redlogde!  There is nothing like riding in fluffy drifts of powder.  I was hoping when I got my season pass this year they would tell me Lazy M would be open on December 1st, instead they told me they hope to have Turnpike open. I know they will do there best to get M open soon.  I really wish they had snowmaking equipment on the backside and also had a high speed quad from the bottom to the top of Grizzly Peak.  Less chair lift time would be great!    
 Overall, I feel blessed to be 1 hour away and be able to get to a mountain with snow (even if it is man-made).  It is nice to just get out and get some fresh air and relieve some stress.  I have been to Big Sky and Bridger many times (they too have ruff times with their snow).  They are great places too but a long drive from billings.  It pretty much spoils you going to Big Sky.  But then you really do see several people who reek of richness and they let it be known! Can anyone say,""STUCK UP!"" 
The people in Redlodge and on the Mountain make Redlodge Ski resort a great place for family fun sking and snowboarding.  

thankyou redlodge mountain for all you do to keep all us skiers and snowboarders happy!  Us passholders really appreciate it! 
Things could be worse!  We may not even have a ski/snowbaord mountain 10 years from now! I think we all better enjoy what we have while we have it.  Its getting warmer and warmer every year and shorter and shorter winters! 

Please let it snow!

On the Snow,Red Lodge,21st November 2007,negative,3,"I need to respond to the rock dodge dude. Up until about the first part of February, I think RLM had the best snow out of the 3 E. Moatanas (B.S., Bridger & RLM). I went to Bridger when they claimed they had 36"" of snow, it was 12"" in the trees and 3"" on the runs at best (never blame the starving though), at least RLM nevered lied. Big Sky wasn't even in the picture at the time, I dare you to ask.
I hold a season pass at RLM, why you ask???? Well for about $300 if you purchase it early, one can quickly find themselves skiing for free, isn't that the idea? I have never ski'ed the backside bottom of RLM.
Doesn't matter! I've been skiing rock dodger dude and not complaining. RLM is a great place here in Eastern Montana, I always wish snow upon them.
Remember when in Rome buddy.
If you can't fix your own ski's, I'll do it for a beer and a good conversation. 
RLM is close and I like to ski, isn't that the point? Last Saturday was the best day of the year so far.

On the Snow,Red Lodge,9th March 2007,positive,4,"More like ROCK DODGE!!! Be careful, and watch out for the exposed rocks and tree stumps/branches. I have had to opportunity to spend most of my skiing experience at Red Lodge and I will be the first one to tell anyone that there are other places to ski. 

The best part of Red Lodge was the back side of the mountain, because of the trees that kept the snow unexposed to the sun and wind. That all change years ago when they decided to expand and open the back side. Not to mention the lift ticket prices changing drastically after the expansion. I guess it is expected to see higher lift ticket prices after an expansion. Since the expansion there has only been a handful of years that their has been enough snow on the back side of the mountain to open it up. 

It never fails, there is always a huge snowfall after the mountain closes down. Everyone says: too bad it couldn't have happened a month earlier. Trust me when I tell you that you will not lose any sleep if you decide not to go to Red Lodge. If you do go do yourself a favor and bring your rock skis or rent some. The price you would pay for in repair of your skis is not justified by the price of a lift ticket.

I will say the town of Red Lodge is a fun place. After a day of dodging rocks and debris on the runs, you will find Red Lodge as a great place to wind down. Go to Bogarts and have a pizza and then mozy on down to Snow Creek Saloon and tip a few back. Run over to Bridger Bowl near Bozeman, MT the next day to enjoy some real skiing!! Have fun."
On the Snow,Red Lodge,16th February 2007,negative,3,"MUST have breakfast at The Red Lodge Cafe!  The Pancakes are world class!

Lunch at Midway is O.K. the views make up for lack of menu,  Bierstube is much better.

Lazy M  is my favorite run. Especially on the weekends when the midway express chair is open."
On the Snow,Red Lodge,4th February 2007,negative,3,"Red Lodge has been a Family tradition since 1988.  In that time we have seen many great changes to RLM.  Family Favorites have been:

1. Yodeller Motel : Your room door goes directly outside but the steam baths and hot tub are great.  

2.  Old Piney Dell at Rock Creak Resort : Awsome.

3.  Bogart's Margarita's

4.  Jagermeister Shot's at Snow Creak!!

5.  Best of All The Spring Carnival.  Watching Cardboard and Duct Tape slide down Show Off Alley is the best!"
On the Snow,Red Lodge,30th January 2007,positive,5,Great staff and friendly people. Nothing pretentious here unles the kids and parents from Big Sky are there. Food quality in Bierstube has gone down a little and consistently raised prices and you still have to deal ski racers completing and practicing whenever they want taking up chunks of intermediate terrain. All of which I could handle if prices didn‚Äôt keep going up including single day passes over 80 dollars in March and season passes changed and higher priced.
On the Snow,Red Lodge,22nd March 2020,positive,4,"Listen, this is a family ski area, notice I didn‚Äôt say resort! It‚Äôs not Vail or Aspen, Snowbird, or Big Sky! But that‚Äôs what I like about Red Lodge and also how people are able to afford taking their family‚Äôs and having a great time. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I liked skiing at Aspen and Snowbird, with their 60 man tramway! It‚Äôs just a different experience and I love the townspeople at Red Lodge as well. Just normal folks, you probably won‚Äôt see the Kardashians there or Kanye and that suits me just fine. You can go to Jackson for that! "
On the Snow,Red Lodge,15th March 2020,positive,5,"Excellent place to ski. I prefer boutique Western Ski resorts like Red Lodge, Monarch (Colorado), Bridger Bowl, and Snowdown with long vertical because of no crowds, no lines, friendly, Affordable, skiing without traffic, and no pomp and fashion show (just skiing).

If you like the hip fashion and pick-up Scene - then go elsewhere. "
On the Snow,Red Lodge,30th November 2019,positive,4,"Just got back from our 5th annual family trip to Red Lodge.  We keep coming back because we love the skiing, love the prices and it is the closest mountain skiing from Minnesota.  It is advertised as Montana skiing pure and simple.  Nothing fancy at all.  No lines, no attitudes and lots of common folks having fun skiing.  The parking lot is filled with pickup trucks and family vans. The best skiing and fastest lifts are on the Cole Creek side of the mountain.  My family loves this place! "
On the Snow,Red Lodge,12th March 2019,positive,5,Red Lodge is a true throwback classic-- great intermediate skiing and plenty of expert when snow is sufficient to open the drain and shales areas-- staff are wonderful friendly and helpful-- the  coal creek high speed quad provides more vertical than most skiers have legs to enjoy- want old school and soul of skiing check out Red Lodge
On the Snow,Red Lodge,1st February 2019,positive,5,The lift failures in the past couple years have many of my friends concerned about taking their kids up there. It seemed like we spent more time sitting on a dead lift this weekend than we did skiing.
On the Snow,Red Lodge,21st January 2019,negative,1,The crowds are almost always thinned out by Waterville and Loon.  Also the mountain doesn‚Äôt have condos or hotels very near which also helps with crowds.  After a storm there are few mountains in the Northeast that can compare to Cannon; it‚Äôs as tough as you want it to be.  True skiers mountain with very little frills.
On the Snow,Showdown,3rd January 2020,positive,5,"Great place to ski.   Family environment,  skiing at it's purest no resort culture.  Terrain park is solid.  Can find powder stashes even a week after storms but rarely a week goes by without fresh snow.  This mountain catches snow like no other.   Great trees to ski.   Affordable tasty food and drinks.  Brownies are a must try as is the chili. "
On the Snow,Showdown,29th January 2018,positive,5,Great family oriented ski area.  Snow is phenomenal and grooming second to none.  Love this quiet and vastly under populated mountain.
On the Snow,Showdown,27th December 2015,positive,5,All natural snow and a great environment! 
On the Snow,Showdown,17th September 2014,positive,5,"Our family spent a wonderful day at the ski resort. We had tons of fun and the weather was wonderful. After skiing for a few hours we went inside the lodge to have lunch. The guys cooking were hilarious and got our food to us in a timely manner. However, the lady at the cash register was suprisingly rude and had no patience what so ever. We encountered her later when we sat at the coffee bar and she made eye contact with me but made no movement to leave the kitchen to tend to us. This was the only disappointment of our entire day. All the guys running the ski lifts were entertaining and accommodating to people's needs. Overall, a good time even for its small size!"
On the Snow,Showdown,15th March 2011,negative,3,"Showdown is probably one of the best. i've been skiing there since i was 5 and now am just learning to snowboard at the age of 16. its great for teens because they have a bus that takes us up everyweekend and we can create our own runs through the trees. all of our hidden jumps, runs, tree rails, and spots where the powder is so deep you just sink down and cant get out make it a funn and enjoyable time."
On the Snow,Showdown,23rd January 2010,positive,5,Showdown is an all around great ski resort.  I would recommend this to any family.  Good atmosphere and good runs.
On the Snow,Showdown,18th February 2009,positive,5,"At 70 years old, Showdown Ski Area still has plenty of kick. With new beginner amenities added this year and fun fall-line drops, it‚Äôs worth a stop on anyone‚Äôs ski tour. Located in central Montana‚Äîin the Little Belt Mountains of Lewis and Clark National Forest‚Äîit‚Äôs central from just about anywhere in Montana. 

For beginners, the ski hill installed a Sunkits carpet this winter along with the Sluice Goose Caboose‚Äîboth accessible right outside the day lodge, where grandma can sit on the deck and watch the kids ski. For carvers, each cut has distinct varied terrain--no line of cloned runs here. The longest, sweeping groomers drop 1,400 feet to Prospector double chair with sweet-turn pitches on Second Thought. Or if you‚Äôre feeling like a show off, you can strutt down Payload lift‚Äôs Big Seven in a straight slice to the lodge. 

While a powder day would lure me out King‚Äôs Ridge to Glory Hole for a steep fall line mogul shot, firmer spring off piste moguls kept us on groomers. Top layers softened into corn snow by mid-morning, luring jibbers to the the terrain park to hawk their air wares and grind on rails.  

The best thing about Showdown is its size: big and varied enough to amuse, but much like a neighborhood where you can hook up with ski buddies. And it‚Äôs friendly: every liftie chatted with me. Contrary to my foggy home resort, blue skies were a welcome change. Might just have to head back for a taste of its celebrated dry powder!"
On the Snow,Showdown,11th March 2007,positive,4,"What a place!! Great for any type of skier. Beginner or advanced, there is something for everyone. Plenty of snow and no waiting at the lifts. All snow is 100% natural. No man made stuff on this mountain. I've skied there numerous times and never had a problem with exposed rocks or tree stumps/roots. Runs were groomed to perfection, yet there were moguls to do as well. Staff is there to help as well, very friendly. "
On the Snow,Showdown,16th February 2007,positive,4,"Showdown is an all-around great place. Good atmosphere, good runs, a varying terrain park every year, and now with a new chair lift in operation; replacing the out-dated poma tow; making the resort even better. "
On the Snow,Showdown,9th December 2006,positive,5,"when ever you go to showdown you have a garenteed great time. Showdown is a great spot to go beacause it has a good amount of runs, the lodge has a good vibe, and the best part is the lift ticket is only $32 so its an affordable trip that is easy to take a weekend and ski.
