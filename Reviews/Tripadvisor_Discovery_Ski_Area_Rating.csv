Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2021,4,"I almost don't want to write this review, because I feel like I'm giving away a secret. This mountain has a lot of pitch and wonderful steep terrain (with trees) on the back side. It was an easy experience to ski here, the food services were great, and we appreciated that people were wearing masks. Heads up: make sure to reserve lift tickets on weekends and a place in the dining area--everything is limited this year because of covid."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jul 2019,4,"Skiing, hiking and mountain biking. You pretty much have the mountain to your self mid week. Remote and beautiful."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2019,3,"Truthfully I was not skiing on this last visit because of an injury but my friends and my family had a wonderful time and I was super jealous as I have enjoyed skiing here in years past. The front side of the mountain is great green and blues, which our kids loved having some independence to ski on their own. The backside is for the more experienced skier and has some wicked black and double black runs that overlook the valley containing the adorable little town of Phillipsburg. But even sitting on the sidelines, I had a great day soaking up the sun, knitting and reading. I even joined an online meeting from the lodge."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2019,1,Don't do kinderski unless you want your child to stand around for two hours. No one bothered to call the next day to discuss this concern as they said they would. Discussed with the owner and he made me feel bad for calling. Terrible experience. Do not recommend unless you want instructors to make your kid cry then ignore them. Incredible waste of money with the worst customer service and complete disregard for the well being of children I've ever experienced.
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Dec 2018,5,"We really enjoyed skiing here over the holiday. The snow was good, we never waited for a lift, reasonable prices on tickets and food. We had great weather and a very nice day on the slopes. Highly recommend for families."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2018,3,"Fresh snow and uncrowded slopes and an extreme discount! We were turned on to Discovery Ski mountain by cousins who live in Missoula MT after another trip we had planned fell through over lack of snow. Discovery is just a ski area though and not a true resort. We stayed outside of Missoula and drove about 45 miles to the ski area. It wasn’t too far but I did have to drive in the snow. Next trip I’m considering renting a house at Georgetown lake near the foot of the mountain to be a little closer. The mountain has tons of trails for every level of skier or snowboarder. We didn’t have to wait in lift lines at all. Seriously never had more than three people ahead of us. There is a restaurant where you can warm up and get eats and drinks. It was very inexpensive compared to what we were used to. The workers in the rental shop, at the restaurant, and the patrol on the slopes were all very nice and accommodating. One of the children snowboarding in our group did a hard face plant. The snow patrol took him to a recovery / 1st aid area where he was checked for concussion and cleared before being allowed to continue. The rentals were inexpensive as were the lift tickets. Amazingly I returned home from this vacation with money leftover in our vacation fund! I should also add that while it wasn’t easy to find flights into Missoula MT that the airport was easy and we injoyed our time in the city of Missoula as well."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2018,3,Really great rental shop staff-Chris provided awesome customer service! Thank you! \nThe mountain is amazing and we had a ton of fun. Really hated the lifts on the backside of the mountain though - definitely in need of some upgrades :)
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2018,3,Discovery is a fabulous place where family and friends meets to have a great time! Their kids ski classes is absolutely awesome! Their instructors are great and have lots of love for the kids! Always great to have a cookie and hot coco when the kids are done!
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan 2018,4,"We actually only skied 1/2 a day on our way to Missoula but it was still fab skiing.\nLift pass was excellent value, all the staff we met, lift operators, ski patrol &amp; lady who greeted us at the base station, were extremely friendly.\nGreat ski area with a great variety of runs all in great conditions even at the end of the day.\nWish this ski area was our local mountain"
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan 2017,3,I have been to Discovery multiple times with my kids. The mountain has runs for all skill levels and has a terrain park for snowboarders to enjoy. I have never experienced lift lines here and the last time I went the temp was -20 deg so there was only a hand full of people on the whole mountain... (no locals just crazy travelers on vacation like me) The staff at the day lodge and the lift operators have always maintained a fun and happy attitude which will rub off on you. The bar at the day lodge offered a large selection of spirits and the food served is yummy. There are nice options for lodging nearby like Georgetown Lake Lodge and Fairmont Hot Springs Resort as well as Hotel/Motel options. Your whole family will enjoy the mountain on a lower budget than the other larger ski mountains.
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2016,1,"The skiing itself was excellent...uncrowded and good snow. however...\n\nTheir website advertised a price of $30 for college students on the 27th of February. When we arrived they refused to honor this price, siting that it was supposed to be the 28th. When we suggested that we would not be returning the owner shrugged and said he didn't care. We felt very unwelcome and that the $1000+ we'd spent for lodging and skiing wasn't wanted...even though there were roughly 100 people there on a Saturday. BEWARE that the advertised price might not be what they ask for at the window!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2016,3,"We love discovery, the way the owners treat their staff, the great maintenance and care to make it a great experience. Soup with a roll is the ticket in the cafeteria, and don't forget the awesome chocolate chip cookies."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan 2016,5,"One of the hidden gems of the Big Sky State that only the locals know about. You will be hard pressed to beat this great value of a ski area. Low cost lift pass, virtually no waiting for chair lift, the views are magnificent and you have much room on the slopes to do your thing. Also there are a wide variety of challenging runs to explore. Food is great, too if you choose to eat there on site. Not very far to walk from the parking lot to get your ticket, either. As I say, this is a great place to ski and one of the hidden gems of Montana and the West."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan 2016,3,"Discovery has a wide variety of terrain to suit every skier. For more advanced skiers, the terrain off the back has a nice, steep, consistent pitch with runs through the trees, wide groomers or bumps to choose from. The base lodge is nothing fancy but works well and is great for families."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2015,5,"This is one of our favorite places to ski all around Montana. The hill offers the best beginner terrain in the state all the way up to some of the steepest slopes that are lift serviced off the back side, and everything in between. The location gives it consistent snow for most of the season. No snow making so they rely on natural snowfall. Prices are reasonable and there is a lot of terrain so you can find some space to be by yourself. There are future plans to expand to the North giving access directly from Philipsburg rather than having to come all the way up the hill to Georgetown. The restaurant offers a wide variety of options for lunch. Very open and cozy lodge. Well maintained area that is a great place to spend a day. Looking forward to some big dumps of snow to get the ski season rolling."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jul 2015,4,Discovery is a great family destination - the skiing is terrific for beginners and advanced. Food is offered onsite nearby. The mountain slopes are beautiful and steep.
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Apr 2015,3,This ski area is our family favorite place to ski. The run are wide open. People are so friends There is levels for every one skiing level. We make this trip one a year and I love every minute of it.
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2015,3,"I regret passing Disco Basin on I90 too many times, that won't happen again-vertical, value, terrain, high altitude snow reliability and a bowl to humble the best. Thank goodness there are low key mountain resorts like this where the roots of riding live. If you are a local, you're blessed with this gem and probably know it. Thanks for sharing."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,,4,"Nice ski area with great value, great staff, good food, and lots of varied terrain. Beautiful place, don't expect high speed lifts otherwise it wouldn't be the value it is."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan 2015,4,"Great Mountain with all kinds of terrain for families! We love it here and our kids are learning to ski here. The types of runs have allowed our kids to gain confidence and ski on their own in just 1.5 seasons. The lift staff on Sunday's is the best. Especially the staff on the Easy Chair Lift. So kind and supportive of all the people and kids learning to ski. The lodge isn't anything to write home about from a beauty standpoint, but it gets the job done. Food, hot chocolate and good beer with friends and family. Oh and its warm. You can bring your own lunch and eat it in the lower section of the lodge where there are tables and booths. The ski school staff is great, friendly and perfect for young kids learning to ski. They are all young college-age staff and so you get that type of lesson. The drive is easy from surrounding towns and your best bet is to get there early to get a good parking spot and get early runs in!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2015,4,"What a fun family day on the Mountain. Our first trip to Discovery, the only bad thing I have to say is please have more signs marking your establishment, it was difficult to find or know that you were heading the right way."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan 2015,3,"This is a great small ski hill! Most runs were open and it wasn't too crowded. Needed to be groomed but due to the rain, it was impossibile to make the conditions good. I like the small town feel and the small crowd. The bar made a great bloody mary and I heard the soups are great!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan 2015,3,"This is a great mountain for kids learning to ski. The bunny hill chair lift is low enough that kids can ride it themselves with no problem. The restaurant in the lodge is not staffed well during weekends, so we stood in line to get lunch for 25 min. Next time, we will bring a sack lunch in our backpack or eat earlier to beat the crowds. \n\nThe ski rental place also gets really, really busy in the mornings. We recommend getting there right when they open at 9am if you are planning to rent skis because the line for rentals is super long by 10am on the weekends."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Dec 2014,3,"Nothing fancy, just an all around good ski hill. No lift lines and the snow was great. Good service with a friendly staff. Reasonably priced. The lodge serves food at reasonable prices and micro brews are available. Nice mix of runs on the front side, mostly double diamonds on the back."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2014,5,"This is my all time favorite ski resort. Nothing fancy.... Just great skiing, no lines.... And very reasonable prices! I spend my entire winter here!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan 2014,3,"This is the place to be if you like short lines, wide open runs &amp; value for your money. We came from Florida with our 9 &amp; 10 year olds and they had a blast. One day in ski school, less than $100 for both, and they were riding the greens down the next day with no fear. Ski and stay packages were just under $100 for 2 adults in Anaconda. If they had ski in &amp; out on the mountain I would give the place a perfect 10."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2014,4,"My wife and I recently moved to Anaconda and are really psyched to have this incredible amenity so close by. Discovery is not Aspen or Sun Valley, thank god. Varied terrain, thoughtful and friendly staff, great food, and just a good vibe. Also an incredible value. Prices for lift tickets, equipment rental, lesson, food, etc. are beyond reasonable. My wife (who had never skied in her life) took a private lesson with Becky and was making turns at the end of the first hour. Becky was very professional and made the learning process smooth and fun. We have already bought season tickets and look forward to spending a lot more time on the mountain."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2014,5,"We enjoyed a wonderful day skiing with family who live in Anaconda. The value ($40) is fantastic. The facilities are simple, the chairlifts rather slow, but the terrain is great and varied. Sadly, many of the runs end with a long flat ski-out to the lift - a problem if there's a lot of snow. Very friendly staff."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan 2014,4,I thought it was really nice of Discovery to run the lifts for me when I went to visit them on Tuesday and Wednesday. There were a couple locals on the front side of the mountain but I felt like I had my own private ski resort for two days! The terrain on the back side was amazing and even though it didn't snow while we visited I was still finding powder stashes two days after the last storm. The grooming on the front side is crazy. I don't think I have ever skied on a groomed run as steep as sluce box. How do they even get the cats up that hill? I don't know that I could spend a week straight skiing here but for a couple of days it is definitely worth the forty dollars I paid for the lift ticket.
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2013,5,"Discovery is very cool. Fun, lively, friendly, local vibe. The front side of the mountain is entirely covered in groomers for those in the beginner and intermediate levels. The terrain park is good for the type of resort that Discovery is. The staff are mostly all friendly individuals. The back side of the mountain is super awesome. Laced with double black diamonds, it is super fun to ski. It's especially awesome on power days because there is no grooming on the back side. The only problem is the positioning of the lifts forces you to hike a little ways in certain situations. But the food was good, and the prices for everything were reasonable."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2017,3,"Well, we caught Disco with plenty of snow and sunshine for our 3 days in early March. Grooming was better than in the past. What a great ski hill. Folks have no idea how big thia place really is. Exceptional value."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2017,3,"We have skied all over the Pacific Northwest and find that Discovery is our favorite. We are weekday skiers so find that we can ski right up to the lift and make another great run. The groomers do a stellar job of smoothing the slopes and the broad expanses on many runs make it seem like you have the hill to yourself. \n\nI am a blue, blue/black level skier and my partner loves the black runs. We both find plenty of areas to satisfy without getting bored.\n\nThis ski area can ""absorb"" lots of skiers without it feeling cramped or crowded. We are so impressed we plan to get a season pass for the 2017/2018 season."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2017,4,"We love skiing at Discovery Mountain, the views are breathtaking! The cafeteria makes the best chili bowls and the price won't hurt your pocketbook. We ended the day staying at The Broadway hotel in Phillipsberg, MT."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2017,4,There are several great cross country ski trails at the Ski Area. There is a separate parking area for cross country trails before you get to the main ski parking lot. This separate parking area allows access to trails on both sides of the road. Most of the trails were groomed as we skied.
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Dec 2016,5,"If you like skiing, you owe it to yourself to try Discovery when you're in Montana. It's a little off the beaten path, but you won't regret driving the Pintler Scenic Route to get there. Amazing steeps on the backside on a powder day."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan 2017,5,"We had a great time at Discovery Ski area as part of a ski and stay package at Fairmont HotSprings. We loved the mountain though there was not much snow it was still groomed and fit our needs. The kids both did lessons which they enjoyed but was a little hectic on checkin for kinderski (I think they aren't used to being that busy, it was a holiday weekend) my daughter loved it. They somehow lost my sons reservations (which was strange because they were booked together) then they made us wait in the rental line which was 40 minutes long and made him late for the class. He was grouped with kids much younger than him and he said it was really slow moving...it was only his second time skiing so Im sure this is why they put him in this group but dont feel that we got what we paid for with his lesson. I must say that the person who we did get at the rental line was great and once we told him we were sent over there and had to wait in line he got my son right through so he could make it to his class asap. He even followed up with me to make sure he made it. I was impressed. All the guys (minus the one that misinformed us to get in line) were awesome and moving as fast as they could to get through the line. I would like to visit Discovery again on a non holiday weekend as I think that we might have had a very different expierence."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Dec 2016,5,"About ten years ago, after watching a segment of the NBC television program ""The Today Show"" I booked a flight to Missoula and ""discovered"" Discovery Mountain, just a few miles from Philipsburg Montana. As a lifelong skier I yearned to find a mountain that I felt I could ski till I was ninety and not be bored or disappointed. Disco, as the locals call it, has not disappointed. If you feel some nostalgia for the simpler days of skiing, where every run brought a sense of wonder and joy, without the glitz of a hundred dollar plus ticket, and a view that stretches for what seems a hundred miles give Disco a try. True, the lifts are slow, the amenities somewhat sparse, but that adds to the charm of an area whose values are that of a family, yet whose back side slopes are as challenging as any I've skied in sixty plus years. The spirit is willing but the knees are weak. \n\nDiscovery has slopes for every skier, the extreme to gentlest of beginners and rates that can't be beat. The cafeteria is more than adequate and the bar serves local beer. The nearby accommodations range from modest to The Ranch at Rock Creek a Relais et Chateau, ""guest"" ranch, a five star ultra exclusive venue. In between options are the very unique Broadway Hotel, and a newcomer The Caledonian Inn, both charming and a good value, I have enjoyed stays at both. \n\nBut I digress, for it was Discovery that prompted my move to Montana and it is Discovery whose slopes never fail to delight that keeps me here, in the Flint Creek valley in the shadow of the Pintler Range. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. You might even end up moving here, but then again don't. I prefer an empty endless slope of powder, with a bluebird sky alone."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan 2016,5,"Great ski area for Southern Montana. My husband really enjoyd his day of skiing. The lodge has a shope for mittens, hats and gloves etc. and yu can rent skis there. Several trails from beginner to diamond. Great day!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2016,5,"I always enjoy making a trip to Discovery regardless of the conditions. The terrain is great, it often feels like you have the whole mountain to yourself, and the lifties are always smiling... But this trip, I finally lucked out and got two days of POW! I wish I didn't have to leave!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2016,3,"Was here for a ski race. Race was well run even though the snow wasn't cooperating. Great value and family vibe. Better food than Big Sky's cafeteria. And, as is typical in Montana, everyone was nice."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,,3,"This is a great place to learn, a beginner and for kids/family. They pay attention to the slopes. If you see something wrong, or someone who may be hurt they are on top of things. Great place for a day out!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan 2012,3,We took our 6th and 7th grade classes to Discovery for a field trip and it was excellent. It was not crowded at all and the rates were reasonable. There are plenty of runs and they have some jumps for snowboarders. The lodge was spacious and had plenty of food and tables.
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Dec 2011,4,Lots of beginner terrain. Crowds are not too bad.
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,,4,Discovery is montana skiing at it's finest!\nLocal family owned &amp; very affordable.\nGreat skiing for all levels\nBeginner intermediate &amp; advanced are divided up by area \nAlso great lessons &amp; programs for kids\nWe have been skiing here for years &amp; love it\nNo lift lines\nGreat views\nGreat skiing!
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2011,4,"We skied Discovery Basin this winter again, and we like the place because of the short lift lines and the friendliness of the operators and staff. Spring skiing is better than pre-New Year's Day.\n\nLift tickets are inexpensive for a half day at $29. If you have a pass from any other Montana ski area you get the full-day pass for a half-day rate. And seniors 65+ ski for $19. We like that!\n\nThe chalet is redone with on-premise burgers and salads and the bar is always good."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2011,2,"Went on Sunday, March 6... had to park over 1/2 mile away, 5-10 min liftlines on painfully slow lifts at base area, old snow, poor grooming, and alot of walking to get to runs off the top. Not what I expected from a small MT ski area that was hyped to be alot of fun and empty.\n\nterrain on the back looked great.. nice and steep, but only if you hit it on a powder day, as it was all bumped and/or scraped off. Groomers were scraped off and inconsistent texture..\n\noh, and the line for the mens restroom was 8 deep.. while people were dressing their kids in the stalls and tightening their ski boots.. reminded me of CA on this day. Not fun.\n\nThat being said, I bet it's a much better experience on a less busy day and with good snow.. so give it a shot if in the area, but don't drive 2 hrs just to go there like we did."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,,3,Great lift ticket prices. Kidsa had a great time. Small lift lines. Will go back!
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Dec 2012,4,"Lift tickets, rentals and food are all very reasonable price. Lots of different runs, including double black diamonds. Even their busiest days does not require more than a few minutes wait to get on a lift. Very family friendly"
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2013,5,"Discovery Ski Area is well known in Western Montana for the great variety of ski runs it offers and family atmosphere. Discovery has great cruiser trails and also offers very steep expert terrain. You'll find something for everybody. Nearby lodging is limited, but many people enjoy staying in nearby Philipsburg, Anaconda, or Fairmont Hot Springs. You'll always have a great day of skiing at a reasonable price at Discovery. Oh, and season passes are about the price of three days of skiing at the larger, more crowded resorts."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2013,5,"For $40 bucks, its an amazing deal for the acreage, the long runs, and variety of terrain. You can run down double blacks all day on one chair, or cruise along several of their long groomed blues. The lodge is wide open up top so its not hard to find people, but on the flip side they really don't have a 'bar scene'."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2013,5,"We learned to ski here 25 years ago when it was $9?a lift ticket. Now after a week in Fernie BC we drive through for old time sake. Still great snow , long runs with perfect conditions and no lines to get on. All that for $40 lift tickets. The best skiing secret in USA ."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2013,5,Super Friendly Staff. Beautiful views and long runs. Uncrowded slopes. Great prices. No lift lines. Great food. Great lodge. Good access.
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Jan 2013,5,"We spent a day at the Discovery Ski Area recently, and while a couple of us choose not to ski/snow board, those that did had a blast. There are several runs to choose from for all skill levels and ski/snow board equipment rentals are available. The cost is average for this type of activity. They could use a few more toilets and sinks in the restrooms to cut down on the line a bit. The eating area, while fairly large, was jammed packed with an outrageous line between noon and 2:30 or so, and it seemed the staff were a bit slow. I observed one gal barbequeing burgers that handles the money and the burgers one right after the other with her bare hands; no gloves, and no hand washing. That was a bit disturbing to me. The food in my opinion was a bit over priced, but I guess that is to be expected when you go to a place like this. There appeared to be adequate parking. They had a fairly large deck with outdoor seating for those needing to rest a bit but wanting to enjoy the action. The view was outstanding. All in all, it was a beautiful day."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Feb 2012,3,"If you want great skiing without a big expense, head to Discovery. It is a bargain from lift tickets to food in the restaurant. You can find any kind of terrain at Discovery. Just remember double black diamonds ARE double black diamonds."
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2012,3,Loved that it was very kid friendly and not at all crowded. Prices very reasonable.
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Dec 2011,5,"This is the Mountain we snowboarded on and we totally fell in love with it, we love to do a few hours of boarding and a few hours of drinking and this was just perfect we boarded till 2 or 3 then went and had some of the best Clam chowder I have ever had ugh it was so dang good I think its because they used dill. I think about that chowder all the time. After the AMAZING chowder oh I forgot to mention the BEST chocolate chip cookie I ever had it was like a mix of a muffin and a cookie together it was thick and moist and chocolity! After all the food we sat at the bar and the bartender was so nice! She was super kind and friendly we loved Discovery!!!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery Ski Area,Mar 2012,5,"Never, ever, ever a line, affordable tickets, not crowded and nicely groomed. There's everything from nice, wide cruisers to double black diamond, through-the-trees teeth rattlers. It was the best skiing ever and we actually stayed a day longer it was so good. Don't bother with the expensive places if you really want to ski - this place has it all!"
