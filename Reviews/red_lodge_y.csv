Y,1,Red Lodge,Heath D.,Pennsylvania,1/29/20,4,"Great old school ski resort in the heart of Montana.  About 6 miles from the town of red lodge.  Not many green beginner trails but plenty of intermediate and  expert slopes including lots of tree skiing.

The food is cost effective and plentiful at the cafe and lounge.

Secret spot - if you have the abiIty, reserve the warming hut and camp out overnite at the top of the mountain.  The views are spectacular and the heat is fueled by a wood burning stove.  Hope it snows that evening so you get first dibs on first tracks the next  morning."
Y,2,Red Lodge,Nic W.,Michigan,3/1/19,2,"First off, this was an awesome mountain to ride. Lots of fresh powder and good tree runs. Lifts were pretty slow but I'm fine with that. Unfortunately the upper level decision makers seem pretty trashy because they charge people ""holiday"" rates even when it's not a holiday, and they don't disclose it on their website. So if you drive two hours to ride here you get a nice little surprise. How do they do this? Here's how, they make there own holidays up and call them real. For example, the end of February through April is all holiday rates because that's when spring break vacations are taken. So apparently that's a holiday now. Zzzzz. They must be struggling if they have to fool their customers into paying more when they arrive. Just be careful. Chances are it's a ""holiday"" when you're going... lol"
Y,3,Red Lodge,Nick P.,Montana,6/11/19,4,"Where I learned to ski as a boy and where members of my family used to work ski patrol.  Pretty good runs about an hour from home.  Usually not too crowded, especially on weekends.  Only thing is that the mountain is on the leeward side of the Beartooths and so the snowpack can be lower than resorts further west.  Consequently, there were many years where half the mountain was closed.  Additionally, the outhouse on top of grizzly peak is probably the foulest one I've had the displeasure of using.  Otherwise, a great place."
Y,4,Red Lodge,Christine P.,Montana,2/1/15,3,"Over all we had a nice time and almost everyone was helpful and friendly. There was a rude gentleman running the 3 chair lift and got upset when a little girl (5-6) lost her ski and  this mother of 2 tried to get it back on and asked him to stop the chair, he didn't try to help out just stood there."
Y,5,Red Lodge,Kelly E.,Montana,2/9/16,2,"I purchased my pass from Red Lodge Mountain reps at Scheels which is basically a pick 6 price for 7 days. When I got to the mountain, they tried to charge me for a day pass that should have been paid for.  I wanted to use the 7th day (the weekday). I was not allowed to despite my voucher.  There were no black out dates for this voucher.  The only restriction was that it had to be used on a weekday.  The day I went was a Friday.  I was told by the ticketing gal to wait at the customer service window.  A very nice lady there attempted to help me but couldn't figure out how to make the voucher work.  She called for a manager.  I waited for an inexcusible amount of time for the manager on duty to get to the window.  The manager (Annalee) refused to investigate the situation as to why my voucher was not being honored.  Her response was, literally, ""it's not my problem.""  Fine.  I said I'd like to speak to HER manager.  Annalee REFUSED to even call her manager.  By the time Annalee was done with her vitriol of not being able to help me, raising her voice to me, and refusing to bubble this up after me having to wait an inexcusably long time just for her to get there, it was almost 1230.  So much for ANY riding that day.  Fix your staff and get a better front end manager who possesses higher reasoning skills instead of being a concrete, shrill voiced wall whose only words are, essentially, ""no"" and ""I don't know"" coupled with variations of not-our-problem.

I messaged the mountain via facebook and was given sales manager Jeff Carroll's contact info.  Jeff set up a phone appointment with me to discuss this.  He never called at the appointed time.  He didn't call at all later either.  I emailed him wanting to bubble this up further.  He set up another phone appointment with me.  He made that one.  It lasted less than 5 minutes of him saying (paraphrasing here) ""do you want a refund or not.""  Basically, he was kicking me off of the mountain for his staff's refusal to honor their sale.

This incident was the last straw.  I have been to the mountain before and dealt with the exceptionally rude ""Old Man Miami"" as other riders know him.  I also witnessed bartenders serving blatanly drunk folks, patrons way beyond reasonably inebrieated, which is against Montana law.  These drunken folks then hit the slopes with no one stopping them.  However, if you dare not have a leash on your snowboard, you will be stopped and berated.

Don't bother with this place.  Go elsewhere where staff knows what they are doing and actually enjoy being there.  Go somewhere that is not as icy as these slopes.  Bridger is leaps and bounds better."
Y,6,Red Lodge,Nicholas C.,California,1/29/12,3,"Decent place to snowboard for the area. Cheap lift tickets, but slow ski lifts.

Although, i still had a good time the ski lift guy ""ronnie"" was very rude to myself and a lady with 2 kids. I was very surprised that a small local place like this would have employees that treated there first time customers like that.

Next time i'm in the area i will surely drive the extra hour to Bigsky area.

Oh beware!! Montana law! You need to have a ""leash"" attaching you and ur snowboard while your on the ski lift."
Y,7,Red Lodge,Jay A.,Minnesota,10/28/15,4,"Red Lodge is a hidden gem! The terrain is 100% mountain skiing with something for everyone. The experts can run the trees and beginners have lots of options. Lift lines don't exist. Snow conditions can be sketchy at times. Red Lodge can go weeks without snow and the early season can be a crapshoot. We went over Christmas 2014 and there had been very little snow. The runs were man-made snow and the big parts of the mountain looked to be closed with no chance of opening. Then BAM... four feet of snow in two days opened the whole mountain up. The temperatures were very cold though at minus 15 Fahrenheit and windy. Be prepared for the chill and it'll be fun. The chalet is old and outdated which I don't care about at all, but you might. The vibe is super chill and the staff are helpful and cool and friendly. If you rent the gear is good, but get there early to avoid the rental line. The ski patrol is excellent and fast and professional (we had to use them) so feel confidant that if something bad happens you'll be in good hands.  The lift ticket prices are a steal. We got out tickets on Liftopia for less that $30 per day. So if the snow is good, and the temps are good, the skiing will be excellent. If you're looking for frills and an excellent meal with awesome entertainment and a beautiful lodge experienc.... go to Vail or Aspen. But if you want a great mountain experience Red Lodge is great."
