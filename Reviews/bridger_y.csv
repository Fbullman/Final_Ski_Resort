Yelp,1,Bridger,Andy Y.,California,12/18/21,5,"My wife and I had an incredible time! I'd been skiing a few times as a kid and she had never tried it, so we signed up for lessons that included rentals. Our instructor (Kristen I believe) was patient, talented & humorous and we had such a fun afternoon hitting the slopes. If you're looking to learn skiing in Montana this is the place to go!"
Yelp,2,Bridger,Patty S. ,Texas,2/28/21,3,"I actually really liked this skiing area. I got reservations four days prior. There weren't a lot of people compared to other resorts. For us, we were happy to have the great selection of greens and blues. This is a no frills place and didn't break the bank like a day of skiing usually does.

The staff for the most part were fantastic. With two notable exceptions and why I can't give a better review.

1) When picking up the ski cards in an outside window, the man in the booth was very rude to the woman in front of me..... ""Put your mask up"". So she did. ""Over your nose"". Keep in mind this guy was behind a glass window. And she was outside. Ick. He was nice to me since I had my nose covered with my scarf. Ridiculous.

2) I was with my younger son, getting on the Sunnyside lift. We don't ski all the time so at first it's hard to get your bearings with all the equipment. They had a mask bouncer at the beginning of the entrance of their ""masked zone"". My son was told to keep his mask over his nose. Which he tried but it loosened literally right when we were about to get on the lift. This guy walked over to my kid (who was on the end to my left) , right when we were about to board, so my son was distracted and I ended up going alone. I was yelling that he shouldn't go alone. So he went up with another family. Let's talk about this........ We were near no one at that point. Outside. Is it safer for my kid to go up with me or another family? And let's talk about safety. Shouldn't he be thinking about getting on the lift safely?

This sh** has to stop. I'm not sure if these people are just drunk on authority but that was out of hand. While everyone else was fantastic, this just pissed mama bear off. Yeah, you.... Dude in the lime green jacket at Sunnyside. Are you waiting for someone to get physically hurt on a lift for this to stop??? I'm shocked this type of thing is happening in Montana. I'm tired of the maskholes."
Yelp,3,Bridger,Pascal P. ,Maryland,4/11/20,5,"Bridger Bowl is an fantastic undiscovered gem of a ski resort that makes me dream about moving to Bozeman. I've been coming to Montana to ski at Big Sky with friends for a number of years. For the past couple of years my wife and I have come in to Bozeman ahead of everyone else to get a day of skiing in at Bridger.

In terms of size Bridger is not in the same league as Big Sky but it's still a very legit ski area. 2,000 acres and 2,600 feet vertical is awesome for a place that's only about a 25 minute drive from downtown. The people who work here are friendly and lift ticket prices are a fraction of the price of big corporate resorts. This past year we came right after the Bozeman area had gotten its first big dump of snow for the season and the crowds & lines were still pretty reasonable on a Saturday. There are no high speed lifts so it can be a long, cold trip up when the wind is blowing but with the low price of lift tickets you can't complain."
Yelp,4,Bridger,Luke L. ,Utah,4/13/21,2,"We were laughing and having fun, terrain is good! The Snow is a little heavy though (coming from Utah). Then ski patrol kicked us out for having a beer, which I NEVER thought would happen at a ski resort. Even in a place as strict as Utah that would never happen! Kind of blew my mind and definitely ruined our experience. Will only be go to Big Sky from now on. At first I was wondering why it was so empty, after that incident with the employees, I understand."
Yelp,5,Bridger,Tom B. ,Nevada,9/1/20,5,Best skiing in the Bozeman area and only about a half hour from town and the scenery is beautiful. I actually go up in the summer and scenic area with lots of wildlife
Yelp,6,Bridger,Jasper Q. ,Montana,12/15/20,1,"Bridger bowl is an amazing place. Current winter conditions are not ideal. That being said, the current management has decided to take it upon themselves to restrict access to an outdoor recreation area to a specific number of people.  Not completely restricting indoor areas to those who do make the cut for daily reservations.  As for reservations, I'm not surprised that all 750 allotted spots went in a matter of hours.  Let's just see if the whole season will go that way.  Maybe they should be looking at how other resorts of similar size are operating in the area(Grand Targhee, Discovery).  Maybe stop all day pass sales instead of restricting season pass holders from doing something they paid for months in advance.   But I forgot they changed their mission statement from ""First to the residents of Gallatin County; second to the citizens of the State of Montana; and, third, to areas out-side Montana, and to do so at the lowest prices consistent with good business practice such as to allow the continued healthy operation of Bridger Bowl. ""  to ""to plan, develop and maintain facilities and services in a financially sound manner which provide the best possible skiing experience at a reasonable cost to local, regional and destination skiers"". Slight change of words big difference in who they are catering to.  Just a thought, wouldn't you want less people from out of state(day passes) skiing at the resort if they potentially are carrying covid and bringing it to a less infected Montana population(season passes).  I would rather the resort be closed for the season if your goal is to protect employees, that would make sense.  And if not,  just keep it open with whatever mask, social distancing policy they deem necessary.  Don't make the decision for people, if you are fearful of Covid than don't go skiing at a resort learn some avalanche safety skills and go into the backcountry where covid can't get ya. Some people cherish these seconds outside and their mental health might even need it.  Don't take it away from them, allow them to make that decision for themselves."
Yelp,7,Bridger,Anna R. ,Arizona,11/16/17,5,"A family favorite since my childhood days.  My family visited Bridger before we even lived in Montana.  Then, upon moving, skiing at Bridger became a weekly activity every single winter.  I have since skied at many different resorts (Big Sky included) and nothing beats hitting the slopes at Bridger Bowl.  
I no longer live in Bozeman but have continued to visit and bring my own children here to ski.  This hill has something for everyone.  Not quite the value it used to be..I remember when a lift ticket cost $19.  But still a great time and a fun, easy going vibe."
Yelp,8,Bridger,Andrew M. ,Connecticut,3/8/19,5,"Some of the best lift-served terrain in the country. A real side and backcountry mecca. If you want to access the most challenging terrain, you do need an avalanche beacon to ride the lift. It isn't hype to call this a strictly expert mountain. If you go here expecting a wide variety of terrain you'll be disappointed. I suspect alot of skiers have come to this mountain over-confident in their abilities, been given a stern dose of reality early in the day, and then been bored the remainder of their time there with the limited terrain within their skill level.

In summary: a truly EXPERT mountain. It is less a ski resort and more a backcountry access point. There's very little terrain for your average skier. There's also no nightlife. Big Sky is where you should go if you're looking for a ski resort

P.S. Skiers from the East Coast almost without fail overestimate their abilities. A ""double-black"" in Vermont does not equate with a double-black here. Not even close"
Yelp,9,Bridger,Jolene H. ,Colorado,3/17/18,4,Great local ski area with solid offerings for runs! We try to head up here from Colorado at least once a year.  Best days here are on the far right in the trees during powder days or in the North and South Bowls :)
Yelp,10,Bridger,Shaun D.,Washington,3/11/18,5,"My wife and I were lucky enough to enjoy knee deep flyaway powder two days in a row at the beginning of March...day two under bluebird skies with no crowds and open powder lines.

It was a great reminder of why Bridger is among my favorite hills in the Northwest.  It's a bit of a trek from Seattle, but it's worth it!"
Yelp,11,Bridger,Daniel G. ,California,1/24/19,5,Awesome but the bartender seemed VERY unhappy to have a full busy bar! That's a gold mine but her attitude cost her a tip.
Yelp,12,Bridger,Jessica S. ,California,3/5/17,5,"Best fries in Bozeman. The skiing is rad too. Add a Montucky for the full experience.

(You get more fries at the DPC than Jim Bridger)"
Yelp,13,Bridger,Lauren S. ,Montana,10/26/17,1,I really love this mountain. But the fact that they keep raising their prices every year really shows what's important to them. This is a college town! Wake up! Do you think people are made of money here? Stop feeding the greed
Yelp,14,Bridger,Aliison H.,Montana,2/19/12,5,"Bridger Bowl is unlike any ski area I've ever been to. The in-bounds skiing is decent and there's a lot of terrain, but the ridge skiing is where it's at. There's an entire chair devoted to it, and you have to have a beacon to even be let up! The mountain is set up on a large face, so there's a lot of room laterally but there's not a front and a back side like there are at many ski ares. You have to take a couple chairs to get to the top, but once you're there they have a mid mountain lodge so you don't really need to go all the way to the bottom until the end of the day. It's also nice because it sort of divides up the mountain and keeps the beginners at the bottom.

Most of the really good skiing is accesible by hiking above each of the top lifts, with plenty of chutes that open up into incredible aprons for some amazing untouched snow. There's a huge variety of lines to take from just a little bit pinchy to more intense chutes with no-fall zones to some straight-up cliffs. The feel of the place is great, too, because the skiers that are hiking know their stuff and most of them are pretty bad-ass. I'd never really done beacon-worthy backcountry before, but I loved every minute of it at Bridger! It's kinda nice to actually have to work for your powder, and it's steep enough that sluff will fill in your tracks and you get freshies every time! If you're serious about skiing, Bridger is a must, but don't forget to bring your daypack and a friend to show you around!"
Yelp,15,Bridger,Megan B.,Texas,1/16/17,5,"Had a three hour private lesson with Afton. I was nervous and a little embarrassed given I'm a young adult who didn't know a THING about skiing while all these little kids skied right by. But she made me feel very confident! She was incredibly nice and helpful, answering all my questions directly and really changing the plan to fit what I needed help with (for example, noting I needed more help turning back and forth so we focused on that). I'm not sure how the prices for packages & rentals compare ($57 for a day, $48 after noon, or $5 for the snowflake), but the ski lodge itself was pretty cheap. Obviously it doesn't cost to enter, but the food was good for the price! it's big and clean, which is really nice if you want to take a break from skiing. It has wifi, a cafeteria, a restaurant, and bar. They have everything you need for rentals--I got skis, poles, a helmet, and ski boots for $40 ($35 on Wednesday)"
Yelp,16,Bridger,Mike R.,Florida,3/25/16,5,"Can't stop saying great things about Bridger.... They just get it.... Nice people, it's not crowded, inexpensive lift tickets, kid friendly, and it has a good bar!"
Yelp,17,Bridger,Rosey B.,New York,2/25/15,5,"This was only my second experience skiing out west. I've skied mainly east coast mountains growing up, and the experiences vary.

But I truly enjoyed Bridger Bowl. It was my wife and three kids first time attempting a snow sport, and it had been about 14 years since I last skied.

I wasn't looking forward to the hour wait for rentals, but as soon as we walked in a guy was there to help us fill out our paperwork and we got out of there as a group in 20 minutes.

We had booked in advance, so we went right through all of the reservations in our package, and we were out at the Bunny Slope by 945.

The instructors were exceedingly friendly during lessons, and incredibly patient. The first day we were there, all five of us had lessons. It had been so long for me that I took the beginner lesson with my wife. We paid for the group lesson, but it wound up being the two of us with the instructor, and he was able to focus on my wife, which helped her a lot. My 2 sons had snowboarding lessons that was just them and the instructor as well, so they got a lot of attention. My daughter had a few more in her group, but she still did very well.

The second day my wife's lesson was in a group of 3, so it seems like they keep the group sizes manageable. My oldest son was the only one in his group, so it was basically an hour and a half long lesson, and at the end both he and my wife were confident enough to venture up the mountain a little ways. My other kids had great experiences as well.

Overall, it was an amazing experience on a mountain that had great conditions and wasn't crowded. My wife and kids can't wait to go again."
Yelp,18,Bridger,Howard R.,California,12/14/08,4,"Bridger Bowl is a great alternative to $80 lift tickets at Big Sky. Not as much vertical Drop but at $45 a ticket and no lift lines it's just what the doctor ordered if you're really into boarding or skiing and not just being on the scene. Mostly intermediate & expert runs but a new lift requires you to take a shovel and beacon with you. It's named for a guy who died in an avalanche. Sound enticing?

The bar, Jimmy B's is pretty basic and so is the cafeteria. If you are wondering about the snow check out if the blue light is flashing at the Baxter Hotel in town. A flashing light means the snow is falling. Ditch work and get out here."
Yelp,19,Bridger,Haley R.,Colorado,4/7/18,1,"Watch out for Jeff the ski patrol asshole on the mountain!!!! He is THE WORST. He ruins lives and takes passes from skiers who are just trying to have a good time. On closing day today my friend jumped over a rope, there was nothing to say ""no jumping"" or anything so how was he supposed to know that his day would end by being escorted down the mountain by Jeff, the rudest ski patrol you will ever meet. My friend Noah was being very nice and understanding towards Jeff and was unaware that he made a mistake. However Jeff was so rude he made my friend noah cry and ruined his day, he told him he was happy to see him leaving the mountain and that he never wants to see him again. He very easily could have given Noah a warning but instead he took his pass and he won't get in back until 3 weeks into NEXT ski season. Noah could have easily out skied jeff the asshole but instead was kind and understanding and in return Jeff yells at Noah and ruins his whole day. Nobody deserves to be treated as badly as noah was today. If anyone reads this that works at Bridger ski patrol I hope you fire Jeff."
Yelp,20,Bridger,Kelly O.,Virginia,4/1/17,5,"Really really excellent for first time skiers! I put on my first pair of downhill skis here and took a group lesson with Tyler B. There was only one other person in my group (on a Thursday, mid-March). The beginner's slope, Snowflake, was totally manageable and perfect for learning on--unlike some of the beginner slopes I tried in WY later the next week. I didn't get a chance to try Sunnyside but it also looked like an excellent next step for beginners after a half day or so on Snowflake depending on your confidence level. Everyone here was incredibly nice, patient, and helpful. I kept doing runs on Snowflake after my lesson and the girl running the lift was giving me tips on form and technique that were extremely helpful! I would come back to this place in a heartbeat. Plus their prices are very very low compared to nearby Big Sky and places further south around the Yellowstone area. Love Bridger Bowl!"
Yelp,21,Bridger,Keith C.,Illinois ,11/10/10,5,"Decided I wanted to go skiing one december and started looking around for places in the states to hit up. Well. Bridger bowl had the cheapest plane tickets and hotels so I decided to hit it up for 1 week of skiing. I read some really good reviews about it and booked everything. Well. My flight got delayed a day because of snow so I knew that there would not be any problems with a lack of snow there.

I got a 5 day special which included rental gear as well. The skiing was amazing. The intermediate slopes here are like black diamonds in most other ski slopes. The black diamonds are harder than most black diamonds. The double blacks are ridiculous. They even have slopes where you have to hike to the top of the mountain. You need to pass a test and have a bunch of survival gear (shovel, beacon, etc.) if you decide to do this. There are so many slopes here that you will most likely not be able to hit every one up in one day. Luckily, I was there for 5 days of skiing so I was able to get every slope except for the ones where you had to hike up to the top.

The double black is ridiculously vertical. I avoided that at all costs until the 4th day where I mustered up enough courage to try it. The slope is really really narrow and if you make a wrong turn, you can go off the side of a giant overhang. There are trees everywhere you either go really really slow (like I did) or you are just really really good. And there are some people who are really really good and just flew down it.

There are also some slopes that if you veer a little bit off the trail, you can hit up a massive drop onto another trail. It's about a 1.5 story drop and people were flying off it. I figured, why not. Let's do it once. Well. Let's do it once turned out to be a bad idea as I wiped out pretty bad. Lost both skis. However, no broken bones nor major damages. Just a couple bruises and a hurt ego.

Overall, I had a blast skiing at Bridger bowl."
Yelp,22,Bridger,JP A.,Washington,3/30/09,5,"Recently visited Bridger Bowl on 3/10 after having just been to Big Sky for skiing the previous week. I must say I was impressed. Although it is no Big Sky, it is a perfect place to spend the day skiing. No lines, nice powder, and pretty decent trail map. The staff from the ticket counter to the lodge restaurant bar are friendly.

And - God forbid you do - but if you get hurt the ski patrol is experienced, prepared and super supportive. I had a mishap (broke my tibia) and Rob came to my rescue - he was awesome at keeping me calm and getting me to realize I needed an ambulance ride instead of my friend driving me to the ER. He held my leg in position until the medics got there and talked me through the pain.

They called to follow up on me two times the first week and sent me a get well card.

I will definitely visit next year!"
Yelp,23,Bridger,Winter G.,Idaho,3/28/15,5,"Awesome, fun family ski resort with runs for all ability levels. The even have a lift that you needed an avalanche transponder to even get on,  a bonus for extreme skiers/boarders. Of our two days spent skiing we chose to skip Big Sky and just ski here another day. Highly recommend."
Yelp,24,Bridger,Michelle C.,Montana,1/2/15,5,I went skiing after a 14 year hiatus. Took my 8 year old there for her first time. The staff was wonderful and she enjoyed taking the lessons. The mountain was beautiful!
Yelp,25,Bridger,Mr. Helper L.,California,3/3/11,4,"I'd give it 5 stars if the food was better.  Awesome fun place to ski with dry powder, variety of terrain, no lines, user friendly with easy access restrooms, close parking, ski check and ski shops.  The food at Jimmy B's and the cafeteria needs help.  Not very good and not very healthy.  No turkey sandwich?"
Yelp,26,Bridger,Pablo H.,California,5/14/09,3,"If you're from Bozeman how are you NOT gonna ski here?  However, I'm not so sure it lives up to its self-proclaimed status of a ""world-class ski resort.""  A great regional spot that would be a real standout in any area outside of the Intermountain West.  But when you have Big Sky and Jackson Hole within a few hours drive it's easy to overlook this local favorite.  They avoid high-speed lifts here like the plague and for the longest time you had to HIKE UP to the top of famed Ridge.  They are constantly expanding however and like I say, if you're in Bozeman, how are you NOT gonna come here?"
Yelp,27,Bridger,Nabil S.,California,2/18/16,5,"Bridger bowl is the lesser known kid on the block but offers great skiing with open space and very friendly staff at a very reasonable lift ticket price. It's a noon-profit, community-owned resort that also caters to the MSU crowd. The ski patrol and first aid crew are first class, hands down. My skis get caught in the snow which caused me to tumble sideways and hurt my knee. I flagged some of the skiers by for help and they alerted the ski patrol team. In 10min Scott and his team were at the scene and sledded me down to their clinic where the attending sports medicine doctor was waiting for us. The doc examined my knee thoroughly and reassured me that it's an MCL sprain and not an ACL tear. The team drove my car up closer to the clinic from the lower parking lot so that I don't have to walk there to get it. First class service hands down. I'll fly there from California to ski there again and again!"
Yelp,28,Bridger,Michael B.,Oregon,11/5/10,5,Steep and deep... Powder hounds and sun dogs!
Yelp,29,Bridger,Jason P.,New York,10/3/10,4,"Been to Big Sky and Moonlight Basin, and looking for another mountain? About an 1.5 hours away from Big Sky in Bozeman is Bridger Bowl which offers a mix of excellent glades runs (check out Powder Park, crazy steep and narrow chutes, fun gullies (natural halfpipes, check out Avalanche Gulch), open bowls and insane cliff drops. If you're not feeling a bit intimidated and find yourself conquering everything thrown at you, there is the new Schlasman's Lift on the very far skiiers-right side of the mountain referred to as the Ridge Terrain. Please be aware that the Ridge Terain requires an avalanche transceiver while shovel and partner are highly recommended.  And if you're looking for a place to chill, roam around the mountain and you might bump into a few of the hidden smoke shacks. For $45 a ticket, I can't believe this mountain doesn't get more cred, especially with the variety of terrain it offers to all levels. My only gripe, the terrain park is small to nonexistent."
