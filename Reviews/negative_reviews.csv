Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Feb,negative,3,Champagne pow can't be beat! Definitely a local small town resort with big powder! Tons of terrain to explore.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Apr,negative,3,"We skied a couple of days here and thought it was awesome - super friendly staff! - incredible amount of groomers - lots of terrain - it's much bigger than it looks on the map, and varied terrain, although it was spring and the ungroomed parts weren't really skiable I would; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Apr,negative,3,"The breadth of skiing opportunities is simply amazing. We were here the last week of the season and there was still a 10 foot base. There such a variety of runs, from the lightest green to the darkest black runs. We discovered Chair 11 with very few people and a little colder; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Mar,negative,3,Our family loves Whitefish Mountain Resort (formerly Big Mountain). The staff at the ski resort is friendly and they strive to make each visit special. We typically start our day at the Base Lodge where the parking is best.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jan,negative,3,"Trying to get a break from the crowds and hustle and bustle of your everyday life? Take a step back and unwind on the uncrowded slopes of Whitefish Mountain Resort.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jun,negative,2,"I was not as impressed with this resort as I expected to be. We were away from the lake, but did have a view of a walking path. I was finally happy to be able to relax and use my 3 suitcases at will, only to find them closed up when we returned to our room. Front desk did not; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jun,negative,3,Visited in June. Chairlift to summit provided incredible 360 degree views . Gondola also an option Windy and got colder as we ascended so jacket needed. Lodge serves basic food from 10:30 am so good for lunch . Bottom level of lodge has activity area for kids to learn about; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Mar,negative,3,the big mountain is getting discuvored. very nice place with lots of lodging available. the Mckinny lodge is been there for many years and is very nice. WE love looking at the lights on the slops on night skiing nights from the dinner table or the slops looking at the town; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-May,negative,2,My hubby and I drove up to this lodge hoping for spectacular views of Whitefish lake. What a disappointment. Not much of a ski village really. Maybe we're spoiled by Colorado's ski resorts. üôÉ
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,Drove up to the mountain to sit in the sun and have a bite to eat. We did not expect to have such a great selection of food at this venue. The sandwiches we had were top notch and absolutely delicious. The coffee bar was wonderful. There are all kinds of activities going on; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jun,negative,3,Great place. Very scenic. Snow not a requirement. Great ride up gondola or chair lift. Other things to do for adventurous--mountain bike and hiking.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Aug,negative,3,Our family of 4 zip lined for the first time on Whitefish Mountain Resort. We bought the 7 zip line package and all had a blast! The crew that assisted us were outstanding and everything about our experience was perfect. I was very worried about going after I heard rumors that; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,The biggest challege is getting up the mountain. It is very steep in places. I was thinking it must be very interesting navigating this road with snow on it. It is a very large ski facility. Our opening banquet was in the large dining area. The food was good but nothing; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,Stayed here for 2 nights for a wedding. Check-in was very late but they did refund a cleaning deposit because of that. It was an average two-bedroom hotel-type room.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,"The gondola/chairlift ride up Big Mountain in summer is definitely worth the price. We didn't have time to take advantage of all the other activities at the resort, but spending some time at the top of the mountain was an exhilarating experience in itself. The bear grass was in; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,This was a fun stop for lunch. Pizza was yummy and unique with huckleberries and goat cheese! Enjoyed the ski lift ride and watching all the young families play!
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,I road the chairlift up the mountain while my husband and teens hiked up. Hike was difficult due to a part of the trail being closed and having a steep detour around.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,16-Sep,negative,3,Took a ride up the chair lift to see the views from the top of the mountain! We were the first people to pony up at the bar that day... we had a few drinks and enjoyed a gorgeous ride back down the mountain.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,"I was terrified to ride the gondola as I have a massive fear of heights, but I had to get to the Summit House for a rehearsal dinner so I got in line. The lower operator couldn't have been nicer. He was so helpful that I jumped right in and up the mountain I went. The views; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,"Scheduled zip line, alpine slide &amp; chair lift to the summit. We had an excellent time on the zip tour (Ben &amp; Alyssa were great!). First time for me and two teenage boys. Note, if you exceed the weight of 230 you don't go... they weigh you (safety). We felt very safe and; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,We took the lift to the top of the mountain and were rewarded with tremendous views of the area. The walk down the mountain was easy and the real highlight was the abundant fields of beargrass. Spectacular. We also rode the Alpine slide a couple of times. I would recommend; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Sep,negative,3,Drove to the resort to check it out. Beautiful place. We could see it from our rental house and wanted to take a closer look. We did go into the lodge hoping for breakfast but they only had a continental breakfast for the quest. Season hadn't started.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Aug,negative,3,"We went here in August and it was 90 the day we came. By the time we got to the top it was 68. The tram is terrifying, but had ""Gondola Cars,"" and may not have been bad. We enjoyed our time there and the place seemed to have plenty of mountain bikers and hikers. We did not; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Jul,negative,3,We went there during the summer and took a ride up to the top of the hill. Pretty nice views and nice shop at the top of the hill. There was some kind of slide at the base to go down and it looked pretty fun but we didn‚Äôt have the time to go down.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Aug,negative,3,Highly recommend summer or winter. Pleasantly surprised at the amount of activities for the summer. Great place
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Aug,negative,3,We went on the 7 zip line adventure. The guides were great- very friendly and safety conscious. Our youngest was at the lowest weight they allow (60lbs.) They took extra care with her and made sure she made it all the way across every time. It was challenging for them since; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Aug,negative,3,"We booked lodging at Whitefish Mountain Resort, hoping to do a few of the summer activities. We stayed at Kintla Lodge, and found that the Upper Village was mostly deserted, I guess due to the construction on the grounds.. The coffee shop is open only from 8 - 10 am. Lunch is; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jan,negative,2,Great snow and grooming. Base lodge is clean and very nice. The mountain was not at all crowded. Headed back in early March!
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Feb,negative,3,"My ski instructor colleague and I skied two days at Whitefish Mountain. Since we are over 70 we received free skiing. This is a major, destination ski area and as a wide variety of terrain and outstanding views of the Flathead Valley and Whitefish Lake. This year they have; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Feb,negative,3,"This is a great resort. Friendly people all around. Easy access to skiing, the spa, and downtown. Kids enjoyed the pool, hot tub, and walking around the lake."
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jan,negative,3,"We stayed here with a ski club. The food in the restaurant was excellent. The service was great, they were friendly and helpful, with good knowledge of the menu. Lots of interesting choices."
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jan,negative,3,"Big mountain is a nice, value, family friendly with good ski school. the fog, especially on top can limit views, and be a little intimidating, but pretty easy to stay in bounds and out of trouble. Great amount of snow when rest of west was dry"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Feb,negative,2,It seems like everywhere else in North America was in a snow drought so we headed here. Record deep snows were a welcome surprise but we still couldn‚Äôt see well due to fog. One chair visibility only. But great snow!!!lifts lodges and terrain much improved since last visit 30; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Feb,negative,3,"Great resort, lots of snow. Kids took ski lessons, very happy with the instructors and how fast things were organized. We really enjoyed it."
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,17-Dec,negative,3,"The meatball sub is delicious! The meatball sandwich is assembled and baked with fresh mozzarella cheese and comes out crispy and tasty! The portion size is generous too. We tried the gravy fries - we're not Canadian, so maybe that's why they didn't taste good. Way too; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jul,negative,3,WE went to the mountain park and tried the Zip line for the first time. It was great. The guides (Mat and Drew) were a lot of fun and very capable. The group was mostly middle aged adults who were a little intimidated but they put us to ease and tolerated our whining. You; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jul,negative,3,We booked a zip line tour. It was the second time for 3 of us and the first for the one. Our hosts were very friendly and it was a great experience. If you have time it is something that you should look at doing. The sites are incredible along with the fun of the zip line.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jul,negative,3,"Zip lining here for the first time was so fun! Our guides, Ben and Keaton, were very energetic and awesome!"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jul,negative,3,"This was an activity we saved for doing once we got everything else in. :) Glad we did. For $16, you can take a lift chair to the summit and back. You can also hike either up or down if you prefer, but one-way lifts are still $9. If you need some coffee, make sure you grab some; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jul,negative,3,"Really loved riding the chair lift all the way to the top. It was so convenient and made for beautiful views and photo opportunities. Enjoyed a coffee from the lodge at the top, and looking in the cute little gift shop. Staff is all super friendly. Would definitely do that; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jul,negative,3,"Although we walked away from our experiences with memories and stories to tell, there were many items regarding our experience that were very unprofessional. The staff went very fast through the orientation of how the equipment worked. We didn't get a chance to go through how; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jul,negative,3,Absolutely amazing views!! This was so much fun and so beautiful. If you like to mountain bike you can send your bike up and ride it back down in one great winding ski slope ride. Don‚Äôt miss this if you are near Whitefish!
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Aug,negative,2,"You walk in and the guy at the front desk says ""what do you want"". Really!! This place is so over-rated. The restaurant is only open from Wednesday to Sunday and they force you to do a prix-fix menu whether you want to or not. The prices are outrageous for the quantity and; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jul,negative,3,We were there in the summer and you can take the lift to different places for walking or grass boarding or using the slide. One ride is free but to go to the top does cost money. There are two restaurants at the bottom and one at the top as far as I know. Many condos for; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Dec,negative,3,"We are from Wisconsin, and 7 in our family skied 3 full days during the Christmas week, being shuttled each day by Meadow Lake Resort in Columbia Falls. We were concerned about the lack of snow before arriving as we heard Chair 2 was closed, which is a primary ski area for me; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jul,negative,2,"As part of our Road Scholar Intergenerational Program we did the Aerial Adventure Park, rode the chair lift and gondola, and slid down the Alpine slide a couple of times. The Aerial Adventure park seemed to be understaffed. We had 18 people participating (9 children ages 8 - 12); ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jul,negative,3,"A great way to spend at least a half a day if you are in Whitefish. We did the Alpine Ropes course (2 hours is plenty), along with a couple of Alpine slide runs and the new tube slide run (Alpine slide better IMO). Ropes course is great just make sure your kids are adventurous."
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jul,negative,3,"Family of 5 did the 6 zip line tour and it was really fun. I, myself, do not love heights and the first couple times were scary, but the guides are very helpful and really put you at ease. Bought the package for the 3 kids to do the alpine slides, but that did not work out.; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,18-Jul,negative,3,"The aerial adventure and alpine slide were a lot of fun! It takes between 30-45 minutes per trip for the alpine slide between lift to the top and then waiting in line. The aerial adventure is a LOT of fun and is very challenging. It is true, they don‚Äôt have a lot of ‚Äúworkers‚Äù; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,19-Mar,negative,3,"It is a big mountain, but the long runs felt rather cozy with gorgeous sceneries especially when the sun comes out. We were there at the end of March so not much powder left, but the snow is still fine. I was impressed with the spacious base lodge and the saying is true that; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,19-Feb,negative,3,"I almost hate to tell anyone about this find!! Whitefish resort have many runs of all levels, the best snow you can find anywhere and it is not crowded. We literally ski down and back on the chair lift! Lots of condo's to rent for ski in ski out."
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,19-Feb,negative,3,"Listen carefully, Whitefish is the best kept secret in North America ski culture, read on and we'll tell you exactly why. Sure it's a heck of a drive if you're from the Midwest, but the local airport connects to numerous cities. You can easily fly to Whitefish and only need to; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,19-Aug,negative,3,"My wife and I visited with our nine year old son and had an incredible experience. We did the high adventure course and the zip lines. The ropes course was a lot of fun, my son really loved it. It was not difficult for him at all. He can‚Äôt wait till he‚Äôs old enough to try; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,19-Aug,negative,3,"Even if you aren't fond of heights, you'll feel safe and comfortable on this fantastic ride up and down the mountainside. You can choose an open chairlift or an enclosed gondola (or one of each). The views are phenomenal even if there are a few clouds, but if you pick a clear; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,19-Aug,negative,3,It was a drizzly morning but the weather app called for better weather shortly...so we headed to the mountain resort to hike up the Danny On Trail. It took us a while to figure out where to park and where to get information. Most of the facilities weren‚Äôt open yet before 10 am.; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,19-Jul,negative,3,"There are six zipline runs and the staff does a good job managing the runs-- take about 2 1/2 hours, but must do some hiking in the beginning. The family enjoyed the slide options, but lines could get very long. It is July and they were still trying to get the second slide run; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,19-Feb,negative,3,"I almost hate to write this review. One thing I love about this resort is it is not crowded. Rated one of the top 10 in the US. Its Number 1 to me. So many runs, all levels, no long lines. Always good snow. People that work here are very nice and Helpfull, you truly could't ask; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,19-Feb,negative,3,Loved Whitefish. Such a great mountain with efficient lift ops and fantastic terrain. Can't wait to come back.
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,19-Feb,negative,3,My girlfriends and I came here for a day of skiing and I haven't been skiing in nine years. I consider myself a medium skier and generally can Ski Blue Slopes all day without falling down but I found the foot of fresh powder that fell overnight to be quite a challenge! I'm used; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,20-Jul,negative,2,"We stayed at the resort for three nights. The final bill we received was around $200.00 more than what I was quoted. Make sure you check your itemized receipt immediately upon booking. We purchased lift tickets, and were told we could change the date with not problem. Not so.; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,20-Jul,negative,3,"Our family of 4 (two boys 18 and 20) had a great time zip lining with guides Karl and Hunter.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish,19-Aug,negative,3,The alpine slide was fabulous for my kids (4 and 7). My four year old couldn‚Äôt go alone but could go with her brother or one of us. They loved it! We did too. The summer tubing was terrible. Super slow going down and not really fun for anyone. It was worth going for the alpine; ‚Ä¶
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,19-Aug,negative,3,"Cannot recommend this enough! The staff were so friendly and helpful, and the view and experience were amazing. We also came home with some great photos they took throughout the tour. I personally loved that they don't baby you, and have you carry your own trolley (metal; ‚Ä¶"
Tripadvisor,Whitefish,20-Jan,negative,3,"My wife and I skied three days here in January of 2020. Great experience overall, though it was cold (3 degrees at the summit)! The trails were well maintained and the crowds were low. This was our second trip, and we'll definitely go back."
Tripadvisor,Snowbowl,17-Mar,negative,3,"If proximity to Missoula is your only consideration, Snowbowl is the perfect ski area. If any semblance of pride in ownership matters, don't look too closely at the filthy, unstocked bathrooms, old food ground into the carpet, unpleasant owner or consideration of annual pass holders. Even the new locker/changing room downstairs is half finished, dirty, and unwelcoming. The slopes are kept well groomed, sort of, but go to any other ski area in Montana and you'll notice the difference. No lift lines during the week and the coffee isn't half bad."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,11-Oct,negative,3,cool town with good eating places and very nice shops to buy things
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,,negative,3,"Had a great time here with family, nice terrain park, plenty of trails, did I mention student discount. Great front desk service. Rentals were a little in bad shape but I seen worst. Overall Great."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,,negative,3,"This mountain was great, pure Montana powder for a cheaper price than I pay to go out on the ice in Pennsylvania. Plenty of great runs from all ranges, beginner to expert. \n\nOnly issue I had was no lap bars on the lifts, that was kind of freaky. Still, this is an amazing small mountain to ski at. Highly recommended."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Jun,negative,3,"Took a ride up the mountain in June. It ended up being one of the highlights of our trip! We pulled over and parked (after decsending and finding a great view), No one was up there, it was so quiet and smell of pine was incredible. We sat and listened to birds chirping and nothing else, it was heaven and the view was amazing."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Mar,negative,3,"If you're going to compare this to other Rocky Mt resorts you will be very disappointed. If you compare this to mid-west hills you will be pretty happy. If you compare this to east coast hills you will be ""meh, not what I expected the rockies to offer"". So with that said and your expectations adjusted lets talk about the mountain itself. Several nice long on-piste groomers, some nice hidden tree runs that get run out fairly quickly and a couple runs for your newbies and kids but not much to offer for the true beginner. That said the mountain and terrain gets a passing grade of a C. Now for the amenities and lodge/ food etc.. I was almost shocked at the lack of a comfortable place to take a break. The lodge is tiny and dated with one dirty bathroom for the entire resort! The food is a typical cafeteria style with limited options and poor quality. There was a mexican option in a yurt that was even a worse option than the typical hot water burgers and fries drenched in canned cheese. The trip up to the hill is long and windy, the parking is below grade, the rental shop had 5 to 6 yr old skies but were fairly efficient given the amount of people. The people however were great and friendly. The town and stay and eat options are limited and most fall below standard other than a few select places. Do yourself a favor and review everything or ask someone whom has been before you blindly chose your destination for a room or food. In closing; I will return in summer but I will question driving 500 miles again to visit the ski resort unless some major improvements are announced. Oh I forgot lift! They still get you up the hill in 50 yr old double chairs and the main chair is a triple that you sit on for 15 minutes! Wow.."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Feb,negative,3,"Very friendly people. Perfect morning of skiing. A little breezy but not cold. Easy parking. Love this place. Skied right on the lift every time. No lines!!! And, get this.... Sun üåû"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Feb,negative,1,"The mountain seems nice but unfortunately one staff member ruined our experience. My girlfriend and I have tried to snowboard a couple of times in the past but neither of us had even taken a lesson. It had also been a few years before our last attempt. We were in Red Lodge visiting friends for the weekend and we all thought it would be fun to take advantage of the snow by going up to snowboard. Since my girlfriend and I hadn't been in a few years and had never taken a lesson we decided to take advantage of the lesson and rental package the mountain offers. Our instructor, Mitch, was nice enough. During our lesson we had told him we had tried to snowboard a couple of times in the past but had never taken a lesson. After he gave us some basics he took us over to the lift. Once we were there we were berated by another staff member. I believe his name was Craig. He yelled at us because we had tried snowboarding in the past (we assume Mitch informed him when we arrived to the lift) and said we should not have purchased the package. He told us twice that we needed to quit purchasing that deal as if we had done so in the past. He said it was for first timers only and that they have more intermediate lessons for a higher price that we should have paid. It was a little embarrassing and made us feel we did something wrong. Mitch did apologize for his co-worker after we got off the lift but we were still a bit frustrated. After leaving and re-visiting the website we believe we purchased the correct package. I have copied and pasted directly from their website:\n\n""Beginner lessons are perfect for first-time skiers and snowboarders of all ages, and for those who need a little extra work on the basics (turning or stopping). Our learning area and easy-to-ride Magic Carpet provide a safe and fun place to get started.\n\nAll beginner lesson packages include:\n\n1 Miami Beach Lift ticket\n90 minutes of group instruction\nEquipment rentals""\n\nWe definitely needed help with stopping and turning and struggle with falling. Craig needs to review their own policies and not berate paying patrons. His attitude and actions soured our visit. I don't foresee returning here and spending our money when there are much friendlier options. Our friends also mentioned that the season passes have almost doubled in the last few years. Seems like other places are also cheaper. Save your money and visit and more cost effective mountain with friendlier staff."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Jan,negative,3,Love coming here to ski. My husband and I are what they call ‚ÄúSuper Seniors‚Äù (over 70) we‚Äôve been skiing for over 50 years and since moving West from the east coast have been coming here to ski every winter. It‚Äôs great for all ages and skills. Our granddaughter and here husband come to ski with us and they love it too. The area has good restaurants and other things to do.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,19-Mar,negative,3,"Great day, sun, laughs and skiing tops!\n\nChange up patio radio music more please?\nBar tending crew always has hard rock or Pink Floyd playing."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,19-Mar,negative,3,"First time to Red Lodge &amp; had super week. 7 in our group &amp; we've been to many different western ski resorts. Kids said Dad, why haven 't you brought us here before? Got 3 of 4 day passes ahead of time for cheap &amp; paid at the window to ski a 4th day. BONUS: After skiing at 28 western ski resorts, I'm now disabled with MS. My cousin &amp; my sons got the ski patrol to give me a snowmobile ride to the top &amp; a ride back down to the bottom in a rescue toboggan for my ""last run"". Nuf to make a grown man cry. My group liked the terrain &amp; the runs &amp; we had a super week &amp; at lunch, my boys said Dad, we got all these beers for only twenty bucks. Gotta luv it."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,19-Mar,negative,3,It was a beautiful mountain with friendly people and a beautiful view. The trails are amazing for all levels and not packed at all. There is no traffic or lines. Please come I really recommend the mountain!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,19-Feb,negative,3,"I had a business trip to billings, and added a day to run down to ski Red Lodge. i'm so glad that i did! It was kid of spur of the moment, and also very inexpensive. $101 for a day lift ticket and full rental of equipment. Free parking as well!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,19-Feb,negative,3,"What a blast! We didn't have the best of snow conditions but sometimes that's just the way it goes. We spent two days on the slopes and loved the unique mounting. Warming huts are tucked away on countless runs and the Mid-Mountain Hut was beautiful!\n\nPalisades offered incredible views and easier skiing for beginners and the Grizzly Chair was great for intermediate or advanced skiers. Only complaint was the road up to the resort, it's a little worn and the parking fills quickly. Besides that the lift lines were short, terrain was great, and staff was incredible! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a big-mountain weekend trip! Enjoy!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,19-Feb,negative,3,this is a fun and beautiful place to chill in the beer stoup or ski on the mountain and great food!!nice people too

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-May,negative,3,Drive from Billings to Red Lodge is scenic in the spring as everything is green.\nTown is a pleasure to walk through and stop at shops and dining options are quite good. Eat at Bogarts and the mexican entrees were surprising good.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-Mar,negative,3,Awesome lift operators and brilliant lift mechanics!!!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-Feb,negative,3,We went to Red Lodge Mountain and enjoyed 2 great days of skiing.The staff at the ski area were so upbeat and helpful. The burgers were awesome
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,21-Feb,negative,2,"We skied her because we have the Indy Pass. The ski area was much bigger than expected. The snow was very good. The slopes are not crowded. It was a great experience having good, big skiing and not having to sit in a lift line."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,21-Mar,negative,3,"My daughter and I are advanced skiers. The rest of the family is more intermediate but they stayed behind.\n\nLifts\nMain lifts are slow and older. You have to take to chair lifts to summit. They have nicer lifts in the back but they run them slow.\n\nFacilities\nAgain, older. This is a small resort. Do not expect shopping, lots of food and drink. The parking lots are gravel and rough. You need to take steps from the lower lot. These are not necessarily bad things but you need to expect that this more of a local hill.\n\nScenery \nBeautiful views and terrain. Some really pretty rock formations and forests on the backside.\n\nSkiing\nThe stuff that matters. I have to state the snow conditions were end of year. The week after we left they had multiple powder days. While we were there the snow was getting thin and half the trails were very icy. Some of the most icy I have skied. I live and ski regularly in the midwest and we know icy. \nI would not take my intermediate family members to this hill. The groomed runs are short. There is only one good intermediate run from. The summit...Lazy M. The remainder are black and double black, mostly ungroomed. Lots of bumps. My daughter and I worked on our bump skiing all week. The runs are on the thinner side. \n\nSummary\nThis is a skiers mountain. Beautiful scenery, advanced skiing, slow and older facilities...NO CROWDS! Town is great with good food. I wish the snow conditions would have been better...but that is spring!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,21-Mar,negative,1,"We travelled from Minnesota to meet family and ski at Red Lodge Mountain. The first day the lift to get up to the top half of the mountain was broken so we could only ski on the bottom half - so we kind of only got half our money's worth (and the prices are getting steep).\n\nThe second morning, my cousin's wife ran afowl of the covid rules by going inside the lodge with her toddler to get out of the snow and warm up (you are supposed to wait in your car all day down in the parking lot) and they were kind of harsh with her about it. So at lunch when my cousin came in and heard about it, he went and told the guy ""don't treat my wife that way"" and a few heated words were exchanged and they could have just left it at that - but they didn't. Soon after, as they were eating, another guy came up and told my cousin and his family and his brother, who wasn't even involved but happened to be sitting with them, to get out - they couldn't ski anymore. They couldn't even finish their overpriced food. It all felt very vindictive.\n\nTo be fair, most of the employees were nice enough and the skiing was pretty good. But it just rubbed me the wrong way that they would pick a fight with a young mother trying to keep her toddler warm and then kick their family out along with a brother that wasn't even involved. Their zeal for covid seems to be overriding any kind of reason or compassion."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,21-Mar,negative,1,"After purchasing a two day pass, and then realizing after only 10 mins that my group only did day passes I tried to get a refund on just 1 and it was turned down. Can‚Äôt go again as I‚Äôm out of state."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,21-Jan,negative,3,"My teenage son and my brother and I did a holiday break ski trip through Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota, mostly hitting the little independent places. We stayed in Jackson but skied Snow King and Grand Targhee instead of Jackson Hole. We skied the Tetons, the Bighorns, the Black Hills and Red Lodge. Of all of that, our two days in Red Lodge was my favorite.\n\nI was concerned that the lack of snow was going to severely limit what was available. Nope. True, two of the lifts were closed, but from what I understand that's not unusual... I've read that some seasons they don't open Palisades at all. But no matter. And I will confess that my skis were badly abused, but the terrain was so fun that I just needed to get into the less well covered portions of it.\n\nMy favorite terrain was accessed from the top of Grizzly lift. There were plenty of black diamond mogul runs from there, a popular cruiser called Lazy M, and a nice blue mogul run (Barriers). A really enjoyable non-stop summit-to-base was to dodge moguls and rocks down Barriers, then duck through the trees in Little Forest.\n\nIf you're looking for glamour, forget it. For me, I think that's what I liked about it."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,21-Jan,negative,2,"It's no surprise that Red Lodge Mountain has been rapidly increasing their rates in the last 3+ years, but now they have a new money grab. Until a few weeks ago they had normal group lessons for the 4-6yr olds, but they just recently changed it to ""Learn to ski with your child"". This is the only way for your 4 to 6-year-old to receive a lesson. Regardless of whether you are a seasoned skier yourself, you now have to pay $59/$65 extra to accompany your child. Their website states ""This lesson program pairs you and your child with an instructor who will teach you how to safely and effectively ski with your little one, while also providing your child with new skills."" Impossible to teach me how to ""safely and effectively ski with your little one"" when he didn't speak to me or the other dad at all. If the sole reason for having the parent there is for COVID then why is the instructor picking my child up 1/3 of the time. I understand making it mandatory for the parent to be there to assist but to charge the adult $59/$65 just to be there and to not receive any instruction on how to ""safely and effectively ski with your little one"" is completely ridiculous. The whole lesson was ridiculous. It was the instructor and just two children. The instructor didn't seem to want to be there. He barely spoke to the kids and gave them very little instruction. I don't think he even asked them their names or called them by name not even once. This is our 3rd time using the RLM ski school and our older child received excellent instruction on her previous classes in that same age range group lesson in previous years. It's a shame our 5-year-old had such a bad intro to skiing with this instructor. Hoping for a better experience next time."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Dec,negative,3,Thank you Red Lodge Mountain! I feel so lucky that I am able to stay safe while skiing. Very appreciative of everyone at RLM who has worked so hard to keep everyone safe this winter and be able to open. I feel safe skiing here knowing that the mountain is following all COVID-19 protocols. Would recommend this place to anyone.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Dec,negative,1,Unsafe ski resort - stay away. I watched an entire chair fall of the lift today as two people were boarding. Luckily no one was hurt. The lift should have been closed for a safety inspection (duh!) after something like this happened. They re-attached the chair and started running it again right away. What would have happened if it came off when the people were 30 feet up in the air? It was really creepy to watch.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,20-Sep,negative,3,"We loved exploring the lovely, charming and friendly town of Red Lodge. As a bonus we learned that the Highway had reopened after an early season snow storm, so we drove it to the scenic Vista. Spectacular views from every switch back, view point and turn in the rid. Beautiful mountain, and pretty streams in the meadow, too."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,3,"We skied at Red Lodge last week. Even though the warmer temps made for less than ideal skiing conditions, we have a good time. Everyone from the lift operators to restaurant workers to the ticket sellers were great. We will definitely be back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,3,We really enjoyed the ease and convenience of our trip. Ski rental and purchase of lift tickets was fast and easy. No long waits at the lifts. Will definitely be visiting again. Only downside was number of runs open due to lack of natural snow as well as use of runs for competitive events that made them off limits to us and no fun to ski the day after. Very economical.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,3,"The staff at red logde are absolutely wonderful.They are friendly and helpful. It has a small town feel. Snow could have been better, but can't control mother nature."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,1,"The resort did not have much snow this year, but we were lucky enough to get one to 2 inches while there. Instead of letting everyone ski on it , however, they let it be groomed into a giant ice block. This reflects some very poor management I feel on the mountain, where skiing is not taken very seriously. I will probably only return when there is an abundance of snow."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,3,"Red Lodge is quaint, the people are friendly, and the runs are well worth the drive. We snowboarder on Sunday and Monday and never waited for the lift."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,2,"Staff at Red Lodge Mountain are fantastic, as was the mountain itself. Was frustrating however that although totally understandable for patron safety the lifts were closed due to high winds until noon that once opened a little after 12:00 we still had to pay for the entire day even though we lost more than 3 hours of skiing time."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Dec,negative,2,"Joined extended family for a ski/snowboard vacation at Red Lodge and left disappointed in the experience at Red Lodge Mountain. While the town of Red Lodge is very quaint and the people are extraordinarily nice, the mountain and runs are very lacking. First, for beginners like my youngest child, there were no good options. The one run that really caters to beginners (Miami Beach) was hampered by a chairlift that was shut down for a significant portion on two separate days and then was coaxed to work by skipping every other chair for at least three more days. Second, for intermediate skiers there are a few okay runs, but none of them were fantastic and many were very icy and seemed to be over-groomed. And this has been a fairly decent season weather-wise. There are a decent number of expert runs, but none of them were all that long. Again, the weather has been pretty good here this season so far, but there were very few runs that had good powder. They are hopeful to open a few more runs in the upcoming days, but that will do us no good. Our family took a day trip and went to Bridger Bowl just north of Bozeman (a 2-1/2 drive from Red Lodge) and were blown away by how much better that mountain was ... and the cost was the same. If you want to go on a nice ski vacation in Montana, there are many better options than Red Lodge."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Nov,negative,3,My husband and I went up to the Lodge to watch the skiers and snow boarders come down the mountain. Had a hot chocolate and just relaxed.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Mar,negative,3,"Since ND had no snow, we went to Red Lodge. We got our lift tickets in advance &amp; skied a total of 7 the 3 weekends we were out there. The lift attendants were very professional &amp; courteous! Hard to find in this day &amp; age. The staff in the rental shop(skied w/one of them) &amp; the staff at the store were also great!. The ski instructors were always busy. I had thought about doing the learn &amp; earn package, that way they could get off the bunny hill &amp; do some skiing w/another ski instructor. But we didn't have time. The staff at the Midway Chalet were great &amp; the Staff at the Bierstube were always courteous. The ""Stube"" was always packed when we were there, &amp; the staff was always apologizing for our food taking so long. I have been in their shoes &amp; understand. We always thanked them &amp; told them we are ok &amp; not in a hurry. It put a couple of the waitresses at ease! kudos to Madeline for busting her buns the 3 weekends we were there."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-Oct,negative,3,"Grew up on this mountain and love it just because it's the local place to hang out - you're constantly running into people you know. :) When it gets good snow, it's completely epic. Most of the year, it seems you're dodging a few ice patches and/or rocky spots, but that's just the essence of Red Lodge. :) Plus, if you know where to go, you'll get the good white stuff!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,12-Jul,negative,3,Really cute town with shops and restaurants. Easy to get around in by foot or car. Easy access to the mountains - Yellowstone and skiing.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,3,So much fun when there is not a lot of people. Had zero lines on Christmas Eve it was a lot of fun!!!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,3,Everyone was very helpful and welcoming. Great mountain with staff that was always so nice and caring.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,3,1st time I purchased tickets online////saved 34%/// dropped the boys and their mother off///parked the truck///walked back to ticket office showed the confirmation paper tickets were given to me///boys were on lift within 10 minutes///// very nice service
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,2,"Half or less open ,bare spots ,rocks ,ice, everything (walking wise) seems to be up hill, anything from parking area to lifts. Seems more like an east resort. Maybe wrong time w/low snow."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Feb,negative,3,"The line cooks don't understand how to cook more than a single order at a time. Forty minutes after we ordered our waitress assured us it would be ready in 'just a minute'. Ten minutes later, she assured us again. Five minutes later she brought us the hamburger, and then informed us the sausages had just been put on the grill. In total - one hour and five minutes to get a hamburger, two sausages and a cup of soup. Yes, the place was full and a few tables outside were occupied. Everyone seemed to be going through the same hostage scenario. I've worked as a line cook, a waiter, and bartender, so I know the capabilities and expectations of a kitchen, and this kitchen is totally incompetent. At the very, very least they should inform anyone wishing to order food how long they should expect to wait."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,13-Feb,negative,3,Having enough snow can be an issue at any resort. RLM has more snow making equipment than any resort I've ever seen. The terrain is really varied so there's something for everybody. The prices are very reasonable the drinks are good the food is great and there is a party in town every night.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,,negative,3,Fair prices along with a good time if theres snow. I've been a few times and when theres snow this place is a blast! If not it seems the snow they make themselves was super icy and the skiing/boarding was no fun.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Dec,negative,3,"While there is a nice beginners area near the base, Red Lodge Mountain has plenty of room for advanced skiers with some potentially deep powder and trees on the advanced Cole Creek side. Lift lines are seldom and the mountain is large enough, it doesn't seem crowded. Even before Cole Creek was open, we could still find glade skiing on the rest of the mountain after a nice Christmas storm."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Dec,negative,1,The snow was packed ice and the staff was rude. Even on main runs there were sticks and rocks sticking up everywhere. All in all I was very disappointed with my experience. I won't be back.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,,negative,3,"Red Lodge Mtn is great. Small ski resort w little lift lines, great staff and the food is always great. Try the soups and sandwiches. We will be back."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Nov,negative,2,"We skied Red Lodge Mountain on Thanksgiving weekend. There were hardly any lines but they had issues with lifts on a couple of different occasions. They have one high speed quad which was not open at the time of our visit. Group ski lessons were 1:1 instructor to student but no GPS device to see how much they've skied as they have at Winter Park, Colorado. The powder was deep. We sat on a broken lift for thirteen minutes in seriously cold weather. We were slightly perplexed at the lack of barricade on the dirt road leading to the mountain. There is no base lodge hotel, buildings are dated but there is a mid mountain dining spot and several buildings at the base that house rental shop, retail, and restaurants. At the mid-mountain lodge there was a significant collection of dead moths on the handrails leading to the bathroom however none ended up in our food. A beer here costs $4.75 and that's microbrew draft. Due to the fact that half the mountain was closed lift tickets were selling at the half day rate. Book two days for about $60 advance online and there are also good deals to be had at liftopia. Still, I find myself yearning for my favorite Colorado mountain with serious bumps, high speed lifts, and multiple dining options on the mountain."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Apr,negative,3,"Second consecutive year of skiing at Red Lodge and the hill continues to deliver. Diverse terrain - including some real steeps and challenging side-country skiing - along with long blues and greens; small numbers; friendly and helpful staff and locals; and real value. \n\nOh, and the snow is just the icing on the cake - simply epic at times. \n\nLiving in Manitoba, we still feel that the skiing at Red Lodge makes the drive down south of the border totally worthwhile. We'll definitely be back!\n\nTip: the lift ticket is already cheap but still look for the deals to be had at Liftopia.com"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Jul,negative,3,"If you are in the area, don't pass up the drive to Red Lodge via the Beartooth pass. It is incredible and the town of Red Lodge is absolutely charming!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Feb,negative,3,"Groomers and power runs. Very nice lodge close to the summit, but unfortunately only open on weekends. Fortunately, the restrooms ARE open all days."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Mar,negative,2,"Skied two days at Bridger Bowl, but knew that Red Lodge had received 17 inches of snow two days before, so decided to go there. Spent most of the time skiing the Palisades area. Great runs and a high speed lift. With the new snow, the rest of the ski area was great. If weather turns warm, they may lose snow fast."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Feb,negative,3,"I have never been to Montana and had a few days off work so I decided to take myself snow boarding. I am a skier but want to learn snow boarding. The drive to Red Lodge was exciting; it is such beautiful country. Red Lodge is a quaint little town with many shops and places to eat. The drive up to Red Lodge Mountain from the town is also exciting. I was particularly fastinated by the sign that requires you to have snow chains or a vehicle that can navigate the steep, often snow laden passage. I realized why on my second day to the hill as I had to climb the mountain in very near white out conditions. Which only caused me to be more excited. Once at the lodge the staff were very helpful and attentive in getting my gear, rental, and onto the slopes. I went right to the Magic Carpet (bunny hill) as my lesson did not start for another hour. The Lift Attendant (aka: Liftie), Bob was so helpful in giving me pointers to get me started. Then, my lesson with Brianna was excellent. She helped me to form a good foundation. My second day on the slopes I went up the Miami Beach Lift. It was snowing the second day so that meant very different skiing conditions. But, the tools that Brianna gave me equipped me for all conditions. I look forward to continuing to snow board and hopefully soon be able to carve like Brianna. Thank you Red Lodge. You have great employees and you gave me a superb snow boarding experience. I look forward to coming back."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Jan,negative,3,"My buddy and I decided that we werent going to hit the slopes the first day. My wife and her friend stll wanted to so we decided to go hit up the bar there. That place is FUN. The food was good but the beers and the environment were awesome. They even had the Packer/Seahawk game on. Next time we are in Red Lodge I am going to hit the slopes, which my wife told me was great. No chair lift wait times really. Only problem is that the power went out and the lifts stopped working for about a half hour or so. I would recommend checking this place out whether your skiing or not!! You will have fun either way."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,negative,3,"Our 5 year old daughter got a great lesson from Ronald. We had a good time, even though the snow was pretty thin. We will be back when there is more snow. Pack a lunch, the food is expensive for what you get."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,negative,3,"We made a ""last minute"" decision to enjoy Red Lodge Mountain while my daughter was home on Holiday break from College-While the snow wasn't great the combined low price of lift tickets on line and low gas prices made it a great day! No lines at the lifts, food, rentals,etc-great parking and the staff was professional and courteous-It's a shame more people don't take advantage of the combined value and fun-We had a really nice Father-Daughter day that was low key, low stress,affordable, and enjoyable-I would-(and probably will) do a mid week visit to my favorite ski area again-Montana Values from a great Montana Ski destination-Thanks for the great day!-"

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,2,Extremely Friendly staff. The backside of the mountain was closed. Single digit temperatures outside.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,2,"Overall, this trip went well... except EVERY TIME we come we have trouble with the lockers! Took $3 from us, so we ended up just throwing our bag on top of locker &amp; hope it didn't get stolen! Grrr! Lock stuff in car!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,negative,3,"I'm a terrible skier, so take my review for what it's worth. I had great fun learning, the staff was courteous and nice, the slopes were great."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,negative,3,Had a great time on the mountain with family. My kids are beginner snowboarders and this is a great place for them to learn and master their skills.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,negative,3,"My first visit to Red Lodge Mountain was on a Saturday, so it was crowded with families but since there is enough room to spread out, this didn't present a problem. There were no long lines for lifts. There were lots of people in the lodge, but enough room to accommodate them comfortably. There were lots of options on the trails for skiers of all levels. The only drawback was the snow quality was not great. On the website, the base depth was listed as 18"" to 20"". I don't think I came across an area that had more than 10"" and there were large patches of dirt exposed in some of the busier areas. With a deeper base and some powder, this would be a great place to ski!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Jan,negative,2,"No snow, which was not fault of resort, but was treated terribly. MOST important, the only two decent runs were horrid by ski racing, one both days, one run wasn't properly signed and led us (with two 3 year olds) to black diamond runs - with NO WARNING; on the second day, we 'broke; the tape on the practice run to get our young ones down safely and were stopped and berated by the ""practice"" team. I am a former professional snowboarder, and it has been a long time since I have been so disappointed in a resort."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,3,"My most recent visit to Red Lodge, I was welcomed by 16"" of new powder! Needless to say, my day on the mountain was great. I grew up skiing Red Lodge and always love going there, even if the snow isn't good, it's a good excuse to sit in the Bierstube!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Dec,negative,2,"Came here with family to snowboard. Before we got on first lift, lift attendent walked passed us and said ""ugh, snowboarders"". We had a good half day, then at two pm the lift attendents started checking for leashes so wouldn't let us up the lifts unless we went to shops to buy a leash. Evidently this is a state law, but we live in Montana and have never ever had this happen and we are frequent snowboarders all over the state. The new snowboards do not need this device because we strap or foot in when we go on the lift. So no other mountain enforces this outdated law because of this reason. Would not recommend this resort if you are a snowboarder. Unless you want to spend $7 at the store for a leash (and put a ring on your boot too because they don't even make a place to put a leash on new boots)"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Jul,negative,3,It is a great end to driving the Bear Tooth Highway. Perfect way to close out the scenic drive and get a few more fantastic views.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Dec,negative,3,"Small town ski area feel. Good runs, nice variety of terrain. Mostly an intermediate's mountain but there is some expert terrain if you seek it out. Lift system seems a bit disjointed but functional. Red Lodge town is fun at night for plenty of apris ski activities."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Jul,negative,3,We loved the mountain and all of the scenery after taking the Beartooth Highway(route 212) from tower junction in Yellowstone to Red Lodge. Take your time and enjoy the sites around this beautiful mountain. Great views from every angle!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,15-Mar,negative,3,Great ski classes the instructors are super nice a good variety of slopes a great little place for beginners I'll come back every year :)
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,14-Jul,negative,3,it's really awesome small town in the valley of mountains. best to visit in summer and ski seasons. It is in the way to Yellowstone national park. It is place to take holiday from concrete jungle cities and nurture nature.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,Best spring skiing in years! Friendly staff with lots of cold beers on tap! Not crowded at all! Excellent snow!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,"If you are looking for a TRUE Montana ski experience try Red Lodge Mountain. Over the past several years I have seen skiers wearing cowboy hats and jeans, a moose crossing the road heading up the mountain and deer running across a ski run. Many days you feel like you have the place to you and 10 friends. Even when there's lots of people the lift lines move along quickly. This is a great place to have a family Montana ski vacation that gives you a ski town feel without needing to take out a loan to pay for it. If pretentious skiers is what you're looking for this is NOT your place. But if you seek a great family friendly mountain with fun runs and amazing views and is often referred to be considered a hidden gem, you found your place. A lift ride conversation here, may very well end in a long-lasting friendship!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,"Despite a cloudy day, we had a blast skiing here. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful as we were not familiar with the slopes. The slopes were in good condition and runs were great. The only hinderance, very little visibility because of snow and a cloud was out of their control. I hope I can come back and ski there again."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,We had a great 3 days of skiing. The weather was nice and warm. Roughly 50 each day. The first day was a little icy but after that it was great. We were able to ski the entire mountain. Many of the chutes on cold creek even opened up.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,2,"Hard ice which made it difficult to ski, maybe a refund should have been offered or not sold ski lift tickets."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,3,"My 11 year old went up with some friends for a long weekend. When I asked him how it was, he said ""I'm sore"". To me that's a huge 2 Thumbs up!

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,negative,3,"We visited Red Lodge over the New Year holiday and had an amazing time! All the staff employed at Red Lodge Mountain were wonderful, from the parking attendants, gift shop, snack bar, to the lift attendants. You can tell that they all love their jobs, they were always smiling and greeting us, asking how the runs are and suggesting where to go next. Thanks for a great ski vacation, can't wait to go back!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,negative,3,"The terrain and skiing are good. The bathrooms in the base lodge are gross -- on par with a seedy truck stop. The base lodge is rather small and is crowded on busy days. Lifts are slow and on the latest trip one lift was running at half speed due to a mechanical issue that purportedly won't be fixed until next year. Food and beverage prices are very high, quality is average at best. The town of Red Lodge is very nice."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Dec,negative,3,We had a great time at Red Lodge skiing. It was windy one day but was awesome the others. My kids are new to skiing and they loved the good options for green runs.

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,19-Jan,negative,2,Mountain wasn‚Äôt groomed. Like at all. Gift shop only had huge sizes in both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs clothes. The Stube (restaurant/bar) needs to be bigger it was soooo crowded you couldn‚Äôt walk. Draft beers were good but the famous beer cheese dip was nothing special.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Dec,negative,3,Great skiing in a true Western town. Great prices for amazing skiing. Easy drive from Red Lodge up the mountain. No shuttle though
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Dec,negative,3,This is a cute mountain. Am I supposed to say cute? Haha First time I have been there. Certainly different than the big resorts in Wyoming and Utah but I liked the atmosphere. Seemed very family friendly. \nThe conditions were way different than I expected but again early season and not really knowing the mountain well we were in some runs that weren‚Äôt my cup of tea. Overall it was a good experience and if we go back it will be later in the season. \nThe magic carpet and beginning area was great!! My husband took our 3 year old down on her snowboard and the price is perfect~ free!!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Mar,negative,2,"We visited during March of 2018 for my son to compete in a free-ride competition and unfortunately the snow conditions were poor. There was plenty of snow but we hit it after a week of warm weather and then cold temps the days were we there left the snow rock hard to icy. The lower mountain groomers were ok in the afternoon after the sun had softened them a bit. The chairs that service the area from the bottom near the lodge are S-L-O-W. Right at the base there is a triple chair, a carpet tow for the beginner area, a double that accesses easy terrain, and another double that starts a little higher up but accesses the same terrain as the triple. But once you get back in the Cole Creek and Palisades areas, those have high speed quads to move you along. The terrain would be fabulous with some fresh snow. The view from the top of the Grizzly chair is amazing, and skiing down in the Palisades area is very picturesque. So it's got a lot going for it and would be a great area with better snow. There's also a midway chalet on the upper part of the mountain that offers a nice bar and grill."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Mar,negative,3,Great little spring break trip! Would recommend to anyone who is learning or already a master! The lift operators are very nice and helpful if you need directions! The lodge is a very welcoming area with a cozy wood fireplace smell!
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Mar,negative,3,"Altitude without the attitude! This is a great, no frills, skiing mountain; no lines, no crowds on the hill, VERY picturesque and inexpensive tickets! Limited options for group lessons in comparisons to other larger resorts. But, the instructor, Jake, we got for our 9 year old in a group and then in a private was excellent. \n\nFood and beverages at the Bierstube were surprisingly reasonable! \n\nAll in all, this ski resort is an excellent value!! Our family would recommend this ski resort!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jan,negative,3,Good mountain for family. A little slick but good. Why isn't there a tubing hill? Really disappointed it doesn't have one as it would be great for families. Need a bigger chalet for hanging out.

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Dec,negative,3,"It was windy this particular day, so a bit of the mountain was closed. As always, though, Red Lodge is a great resort. I'm from Billings so it's close, prices are reasonable, and the people are always nice. Great time, despite the weather."

Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,18-Jan,negative,3,"I have skied 50 years. Started in Michigan in the 60's. Since then I have skied alll of Colorado ,parts of Utah and Tahoe. Stood in line a lot. Red Lodge is the quintessential ski resort. Low key , needs more quads lifts but harkens back to a time when you could take your family skiing and not go broke. Nice long runs , fast cruisers, moguls if you want. No Lines ! Walk to the parking lot bring your grille and cook out for lunch. Not a big resort at almost 17000 acres but big enough and similar to many smaller Colorado resorts. I love Vail and the back bowls but if you are near Billings and want a really nice day of skiing at a fair price go to Red Lodge. The town is perfect Western also ,low key and casual."

Was a terrible season for Red Lodge, but they got this late season storm (after they closed for the season) that brought 55"" of really wet snow, so they reopened the first week of April with super cheap lift ticket prices, so we went. Had an absolute blast. My girlfriend grew up on the east coast and hates powder skiing (I know, I know, it's a point of contention in our relationship... haha) so even though there was a lot of snow, the heaviness made it more like groomed skiing. I though there was a good variety of runs (granted only half the mountain was open) and it felt like pretty good access. The snow was super sticky, but we had a blast. I can see where the skiing can be rough with little snow though. The mid mountain lodge was great with good beer specials and the perfect location really. The rental shop was very efficient and the pricing was reasonable. I really hope they can have more low price ticket days to attract people from the region. My only 2 complaints were that the retail shop was very disappointing, granted end of the season, but they didn't even appear to sell skies or anything besides some socks and sweatshirts. And The road up to the mountain is a little rough with some bad potholes. There were survey stakes all the way up though, so I would assume this is getting remedied this summer."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,3,"Loved Red Lodge Mountain &amp; all employees were so friendly! Our grandchildren ages 7,8, &amp; 4 years old all took ski lessons, there first time ever skiing! Instructors were great &amp; kids skiied like they have been skiing forever, adults had lessons too &amp; learned so much, forever grateful for all the wonderful memories!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,16-Feb,negative,2,The Good:\nEvery employee was friendly and helpful. They seemed genuinely glad we were there. We rented equipment and it was in good condition. The mountain has a little something for every level of skier. We come to ski Red lodge from California to get away from the crowds and the cost is reasonable for our family of five. \nThe Bad:\nRed Lodge was having unseasonably warm weather and not much snow. The groomed runs were fine for us beginners though. \nThe Ugly:\nMy son hit a tree and broke his leg! The ski patrol did an absolutely amazing job putting him in a traction splint and getting him off the mountain. I can't thank them enough for their professionalism and expertise. When we were completely helpless they took over and got us to safety. \n\nWe will ski Red Lodge again. I highly recommend wearing a helmet and staying away from the trees!\n
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Mar,negative,3,"Great weather, friendly staff. Beautiful sunny day l. Lots of activities. 90s big air competition was fun. Nothing like sun, cut off jeans and spread eagles!!!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jul,negative,3,We drove up to the mountain. It was a gorgeous day and the views were wonderful. I imagine it is a great place to ski in the winter.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jul,negative,3,As a novice skier I enjoy the ease of riding down Miami Beach. The staff has been friendly and helpful every time we have been there. \nThe snowboarding lessons for our son were extremely helpful and affordable. They showed kindness and patience with him which made the rest of the trip even more enjoyable.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Jun,negative,3,"Found it.......perfection. \nAmericans need to see this place as classic USA small town beauty and charm. 2200 residents but the town has it all.....mountain beauty, skiing, outdoor everything, at least one parade a month, gateway to Yellowstone via "" America's most beautiful drive""....according to Charles Kuralt."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-May,negative,3,"We stayed at the Red Lodge Inn in Red Lodge Montana. Daniel &amp;Tiffany are the owners, and they are very accomodating, and the rooms are very clean. We will stay there again in the near future."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-May,negative,3,"From Billings, MT to Red Lodge town (56 miles) you will see the gateway to Yellowstone Park with wonderful and unbelievable views, by Beartooth highway! Trees, snow, ice, bears! The place is unforgettable!"
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Apr,negative,2,"We had a fantastic day April 1st on our way home. We were going to ski Big Sky again but the snow looked good at Red Lodge and wanted to try it. The conditions were exactly as reported and it was the best day we had all week! It is so much north facing that the steep trees were deep powder still even on a warm day. The open slopes were fine, too. It was late afternoon before it got sticky. There were no rocks anywhere. Staff was great, online tickets saved us a bunch of money compared to the big places, food good at the midway lodge. Only complaint, and this is lame, is that we had to walk up several flights of stairs after we parked because we got there late on a powder day Saturday and the lot was full. The triple is a little long and slow but Cole Creek was a great lift and all are comfortable. Plenty of mix of terrain for all of us to ski together most of the time, intermediate to advanced. Definitely worth trying for a couple days this season yet."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,2,icy Way to expensive. For what you get. If I had to do it again I would have went to Bridger bowl.for about the same money.
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,3,"Has better runs than found on the east and Midwest, especially for he price. There are NO lift lines."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,3,"We like to hit the slopes here for a day, get-away. The drive is fairly short from Billings and the scenery is nice year round. The skiing conditions are really good this year, other than the warmer days of late causing some crust on the dust."
Tripadvisor,Red Lodge,17-Feb,negative,3,"Great day. Haven't been to the mountain for over 20 years, just moved back to Billings. In our 50's, but think it's time to get back into it. People at the rental shack were great, mountain looks in good shape. We'll be back!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,19-Mar,negative,3,"Truthfully I was not skiing on this last visit because of an injury but my friends and my family had a wonderful time and I was super jealous as I have enjoyed skiing here in years past. The front side of the mountain is great green and blues, which our kids loved having some independence to ski on their own. The backside is for the more experienced skier and has some wicked black and double black runs that overlook the valley containing the adorable little town of Phillipsburg. But even sitting on the sidelines, I had a great day soaking up the sun, knitting and reading. I even joined an online meeting from the lodge."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,19-Feb,negative,1,Don't do kinderski unless you want your child to stand around for two hours. No one bothered to call the next day to discuss this concern as they said they would. Discussed with the owner and he made me feel bad for calling. Terrible experience. Do not recommend unless you want instructors to make your kid cry then ignore them. Incredible waste of money with the worst customer service and complete disregard for the well being of children I've ever experienced.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,18-Mar,negative,3,"Fresh snow and uncrowded slopes and an extreme discount! We were turned on to Discovery Ski mountain by cousins who live in Missoula MT after another trip we had planned fell through over lack of snow. Discovery is just a ski area though and not a true resort. We stayed outside of Missoula and drove about 45 miles to the ski area. It wasn‚Äôt too far but I did have to drive in the snow. Next trip I‚Äôm considering renting a house at Georgetown lake near the foot of the mountain to be a little closer. The mountain has tons of trails for every level of skier or snowboarder. We didn‚Äôt have to wait in lift lines at all. Seriously never had more than three people ahead of us. There is a restaurant where you can warm up and get eats and drinks. It was very inexpensive compared to what we were used to. The workers in the rental shop, at the restaurant, and the patrol on the slopes were all very nice and accommodating. One of the children snowboarding in our group did a hard face plant. The snow patrol took him to a recovery / 1st aid area where he was checked for concussion and cleared before being allowed to continue. The rentals were inexpensive as were the lift tickets. Amazingly I returned home from this vacation with money leftover in our vacation fund! I should also add that while it wasn‚Äôt easy to find flights into Missoula MT that the airport was easy and we injoyed our time in the city of Missoula as well."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,18-Mar,negative,3,Really great rental shop staff-Chris provided awesome customer service! Thank you! \nThe mountain is amazing and we had a ton of fun. Really hated the lifts on the backside of the mountain though - definitely in need of some upgrades :)
Tripadvisor,Discovery,18-Feb,negative,3,Discovery is a fabulous place where family and friends meets to have a great time! Their kids ski classes is absolutely awesome! Their instructors are great and have lots of love for the kids! Always great to have a cookie and hot coco when the kids are done!
Tripadvisor,Discovery,17-Jan,negative,3,I have been to Discovery multiple times with my kids. The mountain has runs for all skill levels and has a terrain park for snowboarders to enjoy. I have never experienced lift lines here and the last time I went the temp was -20 deg so there was only a hand full of people on the whole mountain... (no locals just crazy travelers on vacation like me) The staff at the day lodge and the lift operators have always maintained a fun and happy attitude which will rub off on you. The bar at the day lodge offered a large selection of spirits and the food served is yummy. There are nice options for lodging nearby like Georgetown Lake Lodge and Fairmont Hot Springs Resort as well as Hotel/Motel options. Your whole family will enjoy the mountain on a lower budget than the other larger ski mountains.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,16-Feb,negative,1,"The skiing itself was excellent...uncrowded and good snow. however...\n\nTheir website advertised a price of $30 for college students on the 27th of February. When we arrived they refused to honor this price, siting that it was supposed to be the 28th. When we suggested that we would not be returning the owner shrugged and said he didn't care. We felt very unwelcome and that the $1000+ we'd spent for lodging and skiing wasn't wanted...even though there were roughly 100 people there on a Saturday. BEWARE that the advertised price might not be what they ask for at the window!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,16-Feb,negative,3,"We love discovery, the way the owners treat their staff, the great maintenance and care to make it a great experience. Soup with a roll is the ticket in the cafeteria, and don't forget the awesome chocolate chip cookies."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,16-Jan,negative,3,"Discovery has a wide variety of terrain to suit every skier. For more advanced skiers, the terrain off the back has a nice, steep, consistent pitch with runs through the trees, wide groomers or bumps to choose from. The base lodge is nothing fancy but works well and is great for families."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,15-Apr,negative,3,This ski area is our family favorite place to ski. The run are wide open. People are so friends There is levels for every one skiing level. We make this trip one a year and I love every minute of it.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,15-Mar,negative,3,"I regret passing Disco Basin on I90 too many times, that won't happen again-vertical, value, terrain, high altitude snow reliability and a bowl to humble the best. Thank goodness there are low key mountain resorts like this where the roots of riding live. If you are a local, you're blessed with this gem and probably know it. Thanks for sharing."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,15-Jan,negative,3,"This is a great small ski hill! Most runs were open and it wasn't too crowded. Needed to be groomed but due to the rain, it was impossibile to make the conditions good. I like the small town feel and the small crowd. The bar made a great bloody mary and I heard the soups are great!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,15-Jan,negative,3,"This is a great mountain for kids learning to ski. The bunny hill chair lift is low enough that kids can ride it themselves with no problem. The restaurant in the lodge is not staffed well during weekends, so we stood in line to get lunch for 25 min. Next time, we will bring a sack lunch in our backpack or eat earlier to beat the crowds. \n\nThe ski rental place also gets really, really busy in the mornings. We recommend getting there right when they open at 9am if you are planning to rent skis because the line for rentals is super long by 10am on the weekends."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,14-Dec,negative,3,"Nothing fancy, just an all around good ski hill. No lift lines and the snow was great. Good service with a friendly staff. Reasonably priced. The lodge serves food at reasonable prices and micro brews are available. Nice mix of runs on the front side, mostly double diamonds on the back."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,14-Jan,negative,3,"This is the place to be if you like short lines, wide open runs &amp; value for your money. We came from Florida with our 9 &amp; 10 year olds and they had a blast. One day in ski school, less than $100 for both, and they were riding the greens down the next day with no fear. Ski and stay packages were just under $100 for 2 adults in Anaconda. If they had ski in &amp; out on the mountain I would give the place a perfect 10."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,17-Mar,negative,3,"Well, we caught Disco with plenty of snow and sunshine for our 3 days in early March. Grooming was better than in the past. What a great ski hill. Folks have no idea how big thia place really is. Exceptional value."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,17-Feb,negative,3,"We have skied all over the Pacific Northwest and find that Discovery is our favorite. We are weekday skiers so find that we can ski right up to the lift and make another great run. The groomers do a stellar job of smoothing the slopes and the broad expanses on many runs make it seem like you have the hill to yourself. \n\nI am a blue, blue/black level skier and my partner loves the black runs. We both find plenty of areas to satisfy without getting bored.\n\nThis ski area can ""absorb"" lots of skiers without it feeling cramped or crowded. We are so impressed we plan to get a season pass for the 2017/2018 season."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,16-Mar,negative,3,"Was here for a ski race. Race was well run even though the snow wasn't cooperating. Great value and family vibe. Better food than Big Sky's cafeteria. And, as is typical in Montana, everyone was nice."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,,negative,3,"This is a great place to learn, a beginner and for kids/family. They pay attention to the slopes. If you see something wrong, or someone who may be hurt they are on top of things. Great place for a day out!"
Tripadvisor,Discovery,12-Jan,negative,3,We took our 6th and 7th grade classes to Discovery for a field trip and it was excellent. It was not crowded at all and the rates were reasonable. There are plenty of runs and they have some jumps for snowboarders. The lodge was spacious and had plenty of food and tables.
Tripadvisor,Discovery,11-Mar,negative,2,"Went on Sunday, March 6... had to park over 1/2 mile away, 5-10 min liftlines on painfully slow lifts at base area, old snow, poor grooming, and alot of walking to get to runs off the top. Not what I expected from a small MT ski area that was hyped to be alot of fun and empty.\n\nterrain on the back looked great.. nice and steep, but only if you hit it on a powder day, as it was all bumped and/or scraped off. Groomers were scraped off and inconsistent texture..\n\noh, and the line for the mens restroom was 8 deep.. while people were dressing their kids in the stalls and tightening their ski boots.. reminded me of CA on this day. Not fun.\n\nThat being said, I bet it's a much better experience on a less busy day and with good snow.. so give it a shot if in the area, but don't drive 2 hrs just to go there like we did."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,,negative,3,Great lift ticket prices. Kidsa had a great time. Small lift lines. Will go back!
Tripadvisor,Discovery,12-Feb,negative,3,"If you want great skiing without a big expense, head to Discovery. It is a bargain from lift tickets to food in the restaurant. You can find any kind of terrain at Discovery. Just remember double black diamonds ARE double black diamonds."
Tripadvisor,Discovery,12-Mar,negative,3,Loved that it was very kid friendly and not at all crowded. Prices very reasonable.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Jan,negative,2,"Dress warm for this gem in the rough. Don't get me wrong I love the mountain it just needs a few fixes. Please add a buss from the parking lots well below the base lodge. add a high speed lift from the bottom so that when the wind blows (and it always blows) you get out of it faster. And lastly fix your anamometer, If I had known it was actually 20MPH I would not have driven up, I would have gone to nearby Yellowstone's North end."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Jan,negative,3,"Bridger is a decent mountain that is only 15 miles from downtown Bozeman. There is a good sized bunny hill for the beginners and lots of intermediate terrain. For the more extreme skiiers, bring your transceiver and shovel to hike the ridge."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Feb,negative,3,A little bit of everything makes this an enjoyable experience for beginners to experts. Very nice choice of places to eat and drink as well.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Feb,negative,3,"Do not be fooled by the low price (1/2 of Big Sky) this is THE place to ski, weather you want steep and deep or first time terrain. Friendly natives and a great trip. No housing and you ned to drive back to Bozeman each day (16 miles)"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Dec,negative,3,Ski instructors are very good and again their prices are very reasonable. There are enough ski options on the mountain to make it adventurous without being overwhelming.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Jul,negative,3,"We have been to Big Sky skiing several times and had great skiing. A friend suggested we try Bridger Bowl for a great day of skiing, and we were so glad we took their advice. \nAlthough it is a relatively small ski area, don't let that fool you,.\nThey get great powder, and there are long runs for every level of skier. \nBridger Bowl is such a short drive from Bozeman, we enjoy staying there and being on the ski hill soon. Wouldndefinitelynrecommend to any level of skier."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Feb,negative,3,"Bridger Bowl is certainly the best ""local"" ski area in the Rockies, and perhaps in the country. The ""cold smoke"" powder days, although rare, cannot be forgotten. Bridger has runs ranging from beginning to extreme (i.e., hike up to the ridge with a partner and other equipment). Bridger has been featured in several movies.\nDon't tell anyone about Bridger because the lift lines are still usually short-to-none, and this is a non-profit ski area: The lift tickets are very reasonable.\nThere is no lodging at the base, although the food is very good. You have to drive (or take a bus) from and to Bozeman, about 20 minutes. Big deal! This is not like Big Sky and/or Moonlight Basin, which are about 45-60 minutes from Bozeman. You might want to ski both areas and compare the experience. The people you meet at Bridger, including locals and others from distant places like Minnesota, North Dakota, and Canada, are usually very friendly and entertaining, at least for a ""local"" like me. Many of my best memories are from Bridger Bowl."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Feb,negative,3,"We added a ski day at Bridger Bowl before heading to Big Sky for a week,and are SO glad we did! It ended up being the 'best day of the year' per one of the regulars there--lots a fresh powder and great conditions. It was actually the best powder skiing day of our week. It was a busy Sunday but lines weren't bad at all. The ticket prices make this a super value. We talked to a family in the clean lodge (good rest rooms) and they absolutely love their local ski spot. We did too--there's something there for everyone!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Feb,negative,3,Right from the first phone call to book a trip the ladies were friendly and easy to work with. We made multiple changes on our itinerary and never had an issue. There were no surprises when we arrived other than the depth of the powder that we had to plow through on the hill. We were at Bridger for 4 days and it dumped snow every day. This was one of the best snowboard trip trips I have made.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Aug,negative,3,"What a find. I‚Äôm recommending this quaint ski destination to my sons. How nice to find a family friendly resort that isn‚Äôt so mammoth you feel like you are competing with the world. Only 16 miles up the hill from Boseman, many lifts to offer variety. Wish I still could ski and I‚Äôd definitely go back."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Jan,negative,3,Had a pass this year and was absolutely blessed. The beauty is unsurpassed. The runs are so outstanding. The people are lovely. The warming huts are inviting and a great place to visit. You won't ski many more wonderful places.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Mar,negative,3,"I dislike all the big mega resorts with their arrogant attitudes and exorbitant prices. If you feel similar go to Bridger Bowl. It is only 16 miles outside of Bozeman, but you do not see the resort until you are about 0.5 miles away. It has the most natural appearance and feeling of all resorts I have visited. There is ample amount of skiing terrain for the majority of skiers for a few days and if you are an expert, you just hit the jackpot. Don't forget your avi beacon if you decide to go to the expert level ridge terrain. Food prices are reasonable with hamburgers at $4 and great taco salad at $10. Tasty food as well.\nOnly con is that it aims for local clientele. Very few signs and directions at resort of where to go to park, drop off area and how to go to hit slopes, etc. Hey, but if I must act confused or ask questions so be it. Loved this place."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Mar,negative,3,"We skied here 1 out of our 4 days skiing and enjoyed it more than Big Sky. For $47, you can't beat this as compared to $81 for Big Sky ($77 online). Nice little place, but after a day we had skied most everything.\n\nIf you're in the area, you need to try out Bridger Bowl."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,11-Jan,negative,3,"Value was decent at $50 for lift ticket and $25 rentals. Good variety of skiing. Dining options were good considering this is a community owned ski area.\n\nLift guys could possibly be a bit more courteous since we arent all expert skiers. A few miles outside Bozeman but no big deal, just be careful driving if very early in the mornings."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Mar,negative,3,"We have had mid-week season passes to BB for the past several years. When we first arrived in Bozeman, I thought, well, we might ski here occasionally. But skiing one or two days a week all season really improved our skiing. The treed routes (they are not official runs) are what MAKE the mountain for us. And of course, there is always the Ridge to move up too, once you get good enough."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,,negative,3,"Large variety of trails. Cheap and very friendly!!! Good food, only 20 min away from Bozeman. Love it,"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Feb,negative,3,"nice skiing, and not with the 'be there and be seen' crowd. You want to ski or look good? go for the skiing. Lines at the lifts are not horrible. Go for it!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Feb,negative,3,Great terrain for a medium size Mountain. Location is 16 miles from Bozeman so stay in Bozeman and drive!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Mar,negative,3,I work up at Bridger and am always stoked on powder days. Schlushmens lift brings you to some rad steeps and plentiful powder skiing. Love this hometown resort. Don't forget your apres ski/board beer at Jimmy B's.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Dec,negative,3,The hill is very heavily used and ridden that it was ruts/ice from people‚Äôs boards. Biggest problem is they need more snow (not their fault). Lots of very nice people to talk to. The lodge and bar were completed packed and it was hard to find anywhere to sit. Overall a good day.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,negative,3,"There is plenety of sking for all skill levels here and low to no waiting in lines, even weekends. The ski tickets are quite reasonable. This is a nice place to take a break from the crowds and enjoy a place the locals call home. Ski scools are top notch and are kept small."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,22-Jan,negative,2,"Took family on 2 seperate days during a vacation to ski at Bridger Bowl- the first day was wonderful-rented from Bridger Bowl-had great equipment and experience but on the next visit-had to rent from Roadhouse Sports-just across parking lot from Bridger Bowl- equipment was faulty and put my kids life at risk- when one child had to walk down mountain because board too small-she returned to rental place- the girl who rented said ""OH I KNEW YOU WOULDNT BE ABLE TO STAY UP BUT OH WELL"" and my other daughters skis would not stay locked to boot appropriately--after 2 rescues from ski partrol- they noted the defective skis and apologized but said it was a bad rental place-both girls never skiied that day and left in tears- WOULD NEVER RENT FROM THEM-they knowingly put MY DAUGHTERS LIFE AT RISK for a rental fee!!!!!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Jan,negative,3,"This is a local ski slope just outside of Bozeman. Big Sky is 1.5 hours away, but Bridger is 20 minutes. The lift tickets are very reasonable and the place is not crowded. I didn't feel cheated by a half day of skiing because the prices are low."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,12-Dec,negative,3,I love Bridget so much it is awesome the only thing I dislike mildly is lift speed and I know that is hard to change but if you can please Bridger speed up the lifts to make the last run of the day
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Feb,negative,3,This is our local hill. It has a lot of difficult terrain with a reasonable amount of easier stuff. Snow is usually pretty good.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Jan,negative,2,"For a ski hill its prett lame, especially for montana. There are so many mountains and so much snow. you would think someone would build something to top this"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,13-Jan,negative,3,"I've skied Bridger a handful of times over the last 15 years and am never disappointed. Short lift lines, great terrain for all levels of skiers and friendly people. Always love skiing the Cold Smoke. If your in Bozeman set off to ski Big Sky, don't turn your nose up at Bridger. You won't be disappointed and you can't beat the value anywhere."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Dec,negative,1,"My friend was visiting from Germany. I wanted to show her around Montana. She has never skied before. I went to college at MSU, and recall great experiences and $30 lift ticket prices.\n\nI was excited to give her a great Montana experience. We arrived for half day skiing, purchased our tickets, and got geared up. When we got to the lift line, the power went out and all skiing was closed. Although it is not likely that the power outage was their fault, their subsequent behavior was appalling. I asked for a refund of the ticket as we were completely unable to use the tickets at all. The ticket office people were rude and condescending when approaching them about a refund. I called the office a couple days later to ask if we could return to attempt another visit using our already purchased tickets. Again, the ticket office staff were rude and condescending. Basically elitist pricks. They made it sound like I didn‚Äôt belong in Bozeman where everyone apparently has excessive amounts of money to throw around. They made it sound like it was my fault for their power outage. The person on the phone stated that it was my fault ‚Äúfor not arriving earlier in the day‚Äù. Unfortunately our itinerary only allowed for a late half day visit. \n\nNot only have they refused to honor our unused tickets but they made themselves sound like rootless cosmopolitans who are too elitist for your average Montanan. \n\nI recommend avoiding this place. Bridger operates on public land leased to them but they don‚Äôt act like they respect their privilege to do so.\n\nSave your money and invest in randonee gear and explore the mountains on your own."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Dec,negative,3,"Went in 1999 and they improved a lot. More things for skiing. New place for beginners separate from the experience skiers. You can bring your dogs, too. Have snow making machines. Ready anytime in winter."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Feb,negative,3,"We had the mountain to ourselves on a recent COLD February morning. While the lodge leaves you feeling that it is lacking, the skiing is top notch!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Feb,negative,2,Even though the tickets are affordable the crowds have really increased and the kids ski very fast and out of controll\nThere isn't much supervision controlling speed and drinking on the mountain by the skipatrol or the mountain staff.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Nov,negative,3,"For those of whom don't ski they may sit inside, enjoy hot coffee, cocoa and gaze out the huge windows to watch the beauty of dancing slopes of the Bridger Mt's. There are also low-cost lessons for all levels w/ lockers to place all items. It's good to arrive early so you may find a free place to park or take the free shuttle to the slopes. For skiers think cold w/ proper layers of clothing. If one loses their hat, gloves they have lost &amp; found. Enjoy all w/ camera. Great 1st aid station."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,negative,3,"We had spring skiing conditions and a need for some WAX. No crowds, friendly atmo. Potential for some epic powder skiing above the in area lifts - need avy gear. Price is right, compared to Big Sky"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,negative,3,My first visit to Bridger Bowl yielded a fantastic Spring Day. I enjoyed the terrain. Next time I'll be prepared to hike the Ridge.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Feb,negative,3,"We are coming every year here for our family week long ski trip. This is not a huge resort, but there are enough trails for a week, with various levels. The prices are very reasonable, which is important for a family of 4 adults! We rent our skis from the lodge, book our hotel with the reservation center, and all the staff is extremely nice and friendly. Thanks Travis for always helping us! We love Bridger and will come back every year until we can ski for free at 80, right?"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,negative,3,"Travelled with my daughter on a spring break trip. Snow and terrain were awesome. We have been coming here for years as a family, best ski area for the money."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,negative,3,"The ski area is getting to be much more crowded than it used to be, but is still my top choice in the Bozeman/Big Sky area for a weekday ski. There is a lunch cafeteria at the base and also one on the mountain by the bridger lift with some homemade food options."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Mar,negative,3,"Bridger Bowl is a wonderful local ski area with reasonable rates for skiing and very competent people working in all phases of resort operation. The ski patrol is first class. The snow can be a little variable from year to year, but when it's good it's really good. Unfortunately, it has become too popular so weekends can be a total zoo."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Feb,negative,3,Bridger Bowl is a great local ski area. It is not crowded on the week days unless it's a holiday. Great runs for all levels of skiing.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,17-Feb,negative,3,"Just 20 minutes from beautiful Bozeman, Montana, Bridger is the perfect area to take the family to ski! No long lines, great instructors, amazing conditions. You cannot beat Bridger for best Return on Vacation Investment!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Mar,negative,3,"Bridger is a great mountain that is only about a 15-20 minute drive from downtown Bozeman. Most people probably visit Bozeman from out of state to ski nearby Big Sky Resort, but that's fine with us."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Apr,negative,3,"Bridger Bowl is only 16 miles from Bozeman making it a playground for winter sports enthusiasts in the area. Excellent expert terrain, less expensive than many ski areas, inexpensive season passes, all lifts have moving carpets for smooth loading. Been skiing/snowboarding there for nearly 30 years now."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,negative,3,Our first time to Bridger and really enjoyed it. Affordable skiing and a nice variety of terrain. Blessed with fresh snow so had lots of powder to play in but also nice groomers. Staff is friendly too.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,negative,3,"Fantastic fun for the family! Great runs, friendly and low key, totally uncommercial and anti-resort in nature, with a price point to match."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,negative,3,"Bridger is my favorite place to ski and mostly that is because of the people that work here. Don't get me wrong, the slopes are great. My kids are 8 and 10 and they can go up virtually any chairlift and find their way down without getting into trouble. There is truly something for every level of skier. The ski school is fantastic. We generally get our kids a 90 minute private lesson because we only get out a couple times each year and we have never been disappointed. Patrick is our favorite instructor and my 10 year old daughter requests him every year. There are 4 lodges that serve food and the prices are reasonable and the food is good. The people working on the mountain, whether they are serving food or running the chair lift are fantastic. They are smiling and happy and always have kind words. I have no idea why anyone would spend twice as much to go to Big Sky when Bridger Bowl has so much to offer. It is a short drive from Bozeman which has lots of choices for lodging and food."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jan,negative,3,"Good terrain, but slower lifts. Still short lines compared to bigger resorts. Be sure to get some of the famous fries at the mid-mountain lodge. But be forewarned, the serving is not for a single person-- definitely need to share!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Mar,negative,3,"We had a great ski experience at Bridger! The benefits of skiing here outweighed driving to Big Sky \n\nPros: Very economical - young kids free if only asking on bottom of mountain, 20-30 minute drive from Bozeman, easy parking, rental, lift tix, children class sign up, ski school was helpful for our 6 year old and ended up being solo in group class, not crowded, very short lift lines, good slopes, modern lifts.\n\nCons: not as extensive or large as some competitors..., more limited terrain park, some longer flat areas down low.\n\nNeutral: Culinary/ bar options are fine but less extensive than larger competitors"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jan,negative,3,"Even though I fell and thought my collar bone was broken, I still had fun. The staff really helped out when I fell and got me down the mountain and to the aid station quick. Before my incident, I was having a ton of fun and was blown away by how beautiful it was and how great the powder was!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jan,negative,3,"Amazing mountain. Really good terrain for everyone, from beginner flats on the bottom half to the crazy stuff off the schlasman chair. What really made me fall in love with this place and Bozeman in general though is the people. Everyone is super friendly and doesn't hesitate to point you towards the goods.\n\nCan't wait to go back :)"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Mar,negative,3,"We experienced one of the greatest snow days on our recent vaction. The lodge is very comfortable, the food was exellent and the sking was fantastic. We were there midweek and there was little to no waiting on the lifts. There are many diverse runs and excellent lifts. Looking forward to going there again."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Mar,negative,3,"I was told Bridger Bowl was a good mountain to ski, so I checked it out. It was pleasant. I went in the week, so it wasn't busy. There were no lines to the chairlift. I got quite a few runs in. There are some challenging trails there. It is a moderate sized mountain and not small by any means. The price of a lift ticket for the day is definitely worth it."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Jan,negative,3,"Loved skiing Bridger Bowl! Lots of easy trails but once you get above them, there‚Äôs lots of fun variety. Alpine lift gets you up into some gorgeous runs that smell like Christmas trees. Pierre‚Äôs Knob has some pretty fast/steep runs. The lodges are clean &amp; well-maintained; food is perfectly reasonable."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Jun,negative,3,"If you want to ski or just get in touch with nature then this is the place for you. If, like me, you have hard, icy snow in your country then Brider Bowl has lots of soft, fluffy snow. There are easy, hard and bumpy runs, each with a spectacular view from the top. You must ski the bowl some time. In summer, an equally nice place to visit. The drive up to Bridger is part of the fun going under stone arches and passing rivers and ranches on the way."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Jul,negative,3,"Was in the area visiting friends. They brought us up to Bridger Bowl to see where their kids ski in the winter. Even in the summer, the area is breathtaking..."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Mar,negative,3,"Close, great terrain, cheap, and fun. When there is snow its one of my favorite mountains to ride. Its a must experience for sure."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Nov,negative,3,We bought a season pass and loved that we could go up easily on any week day and park a short walk from the ski slopes. I had an accident on the last day of the season and they took great care of me too!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Dec,negative,3,"Can't beat the price for kids, only $19. Decent variety of runs. .. Doesn't have some of the amenities of larger ski resorts. ..ie: some of the lifts seemed dated and slow, not many foot rests, runs not well labeled... However the snow was fantastic, we never waited in line (and it is a holiday week), and our ski instructor seemed to like his job! Eat early on the mountain if you are going to, they close must of those 2ish..then your only option is the bar in the lodge ..oh and they have a parking lot close in for cars with more than 3 occupants, take the closer parking families! overall we enjoyed the value AND beauty of this resort."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Mar,negative,3,"We loved Bridger! While it is ""smaller"" (fewer lifts, runs) than other mega-resorts, it is more than big enough to be enjoyable for all levels of skiers on a multi-day ski vacation. Lift prices (especially for kids) are unbeatable! We didn't encounter any lines/crowds and the snow was spectacular! Varied terrain - wide open spaces and trees and everything in between. We didn't cover any of the extreme terrain, but it was fun to watch from the lifts as other skiers tackled the ""scary stuff"". We will return!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,15-Dec,negative,3,"This is the best skiing in Montana, even the ""world famous"" Big Sky does not stand a chance against bridger bowl, this is the place to ski, with very reasonable lift prices, skiing for all skill levels, and pretty good food."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Apr,negative,3,"Nice quiet slope. No high speed quads, but nice place close to Bozeman to board with the locals. Has some awesome snow and really nice runs. Combined with the cheap lift tickets it's hard to beat!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Dec,negative,3,"The place is simply amazing, the mountains and the trails are awesome! We had a big group from beginners to advanced and everyone had a blast ! My soon joined the ski school and he got much more confident. We had some issues with our skis , and even being our personal equipment the crew was amazing to support and make out experience delightful and unforgettable! We can‚Äôt wait to be back !!!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Feb,negative,3,"A smaller ski destination however PLENTY of skiing terrain from back-country/beacon-required ridges to nicely novice; no-pretense; no-glitz; affordable (compared to Big Sky); rarely lift-lines. A community-serving non-profit. Excellent ski school and competent rescue (required, alas, when a companion concussed on hard-pack.... it's why one wears a helmet, right?). The BEST!"
Tripadvisor,Bridger,19-Jan,negative,3,"Bridger Bowl is amazing! It was runs for all levels, and lots of them, you couldn't get bored. Much more reasonable pricing than Big Sky or other more famous ski areas. And the conveyor belts under the chair lifts are fabulous, more ski fields should utilise them."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,18-Dec,negative,3,I typically ski in the Tahoe basin - i.e. sierra cement - and it was nice to finally experience some cold smoke!! This is a very nice resort with terrain that will please everyone! We were there over the Christmas holiday and even then we never waited more than a minute or two to get on the lift. Easy parking - and if you carpool it's even better. If you are in the area and looking to ski/snowboard this is a must!!
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,negative,3,Most people are drawn to Bozeman to ski Big Sky. Take a day to ski the local hill and always check for the flashing light on the Baxter Hotel. Calling locals to great skiing. Bridger is half the cost and a great experience.
Tripadvisor,Bridger,16-Feb,negative,3,"This area is great to use. Don't expect high speed quads but enjoy the way skiing is meant to be enjoyed. Great variety of slopes, something for everyone."
Tripadvisor,Bridger,14-Feb,negative,3,"Very nice terrain, helpful staff. Need to get there early to avoid a long walk from the parking lot. Wish they had shuttle service from Bozeman on weekdays."
Yelp,Snowbowl,7/26/17,negative,3,"A group of 5 had made plans to try the zip lines at Sowbowl. Based on our group size and the time of day, as their recording said to leave a message. We left no less than 4 messages over the span of 3 days. Not once did a single employee bother to call us back to confirm that our requested time was okay. We did show up and they were wonderful to us. The experience was fun but a tad slow due to the group of nearly 20. Nothing special that I have to go back for more. Appreciate the staffs friendliness and safety."
Yelp,Snowbowl,8/23/15,negative,1,"I wasn't allowed on the zipline tour because of my weight.  That's fine, but my group should have been refunded.  The weight requirement is barely featured on the website, and not at all featured on the waiver--the employees at Snowbowl even admitted they've been trying to convince their boss to make it more prominent.  (I can promise you that their policy of not giving refunds is a lot more prominently featured.)  The best the boss (I think it was Nick?) could say was that they couldn't up the weight maximum without increasing the minimum too, which I guess would interfere with all the 60-pounders trying to ride.

So thanks for ruining our Friday afternoon, and I especially enjoy being called out for being a fatass in front of all your customers."
Yelp,Snowbowl,7/22/15,negative,3,"This review is for the new zip lines. for comparison I have been on a number of these throughout the western hemisphere. I think whoever taught the workers may have been overly cautious, but while the lines where fun and nice and long and high, you can not enjoy the ride. 
on all others we've been on, the instructions were similar in going fast or slowing down, you were able to what you wished. 
on these you had to watch the landing crew and go into high drag mode when the signaled you hence not being able to enjoy the views or speed at your leisure. the stopping system was identical to others we have experienced but could land at any speed. 
also the hike to the second line is grueling. other places have had some kind of transport up the hill like a surplus military transport or the like. 
the price point is correct for what you get with the exception of the lack of transport. 
the pizza was good but needs more sauce."
Yelp,Red Lodge,3/1/19,negative,2,"First off, this was an awesome mountain to ride. Lots of fresh powder and good tree runs. Lifts were pretty slow but I'm fine with that. Unfortunately the upper level decision makers seem pretty trashy because they charge people ""holiday"" rates even when it's not a holiday, and they don't disclose it on their website. So if you drive two hours to ride here you get a nice little surprise. How do they do this? Here's how, they make there own holidays up and call them real. For example, the end of February through April is all holiday rates because that's when spring break vacations are taken. So apparently that's a holiday now. Zzzzz. They must be struggling if they have to fool their customers into paying more when they arrive. Just be careful. Chances are it's a ""holiday"" when you're going... lol"
Yelp,Red Lodge,2/1/15,negative,3,"Over all we had a nice time and almost everyone was helpful and friendly. There was a rude gentleman running the 3 chair lift and got upset when a little girl (5-6) lost her ski and  this mother of 2 tried to get it back on and asked him to stop the chair, he didn't try to help out just stood there."
Yelp,Red Lodge,2/9/16,negative,2,"I purchased my pass from Red Lodge Mountain reps at Scheels which is basically a pick 6 price for 7 days. When I got to the mountain, they tried to charge me for a day pass that should have been paid for.  I wanted to use the 7th day (the weekday). I was not allowed to despite my voucher.  There were no black out dates for this voucher.  The only restriction was that it had to be used on a weekday.  The day I went was a Friday.  I was told by the ticketing gal to wait at the customer service window.  A very nice lady there attempted to help me but couldn't figure out how to make the voucher work.  She called for a manager.  I waited for an inexcusible amount of time for the manager on duty to get to the window.  The manager (Annalee) refused to investigate the situation as to why my voucher was not being honored.  Her response was, literally, ""it's not my problem.""  Fine.  I said I'd like to speak to HER manager.  Annalee REFUSED to even call her manager.  By the time Annalee was done with her vitriol of not being able to help me, raising her voice to me, and refusing to bubble this up after me having to wait an inexcusably long time just for her to get there, it was almost 1230.  So much for ANY riding that day.  Fix your staff and get a better front end manager who possesses higher reasoning skills instead of being a concrete, shrill voiced wall whose only words are, essentially, ""no"" and ""I don't know"" coupled with variations of not-our-problem.

I messaged the mountain via facebook and was given sales manager Jeff Carroll's contact info.  Jeff set up a phone appointment with me to discuss this.  He never called at the appointed time.  He didn't call at all later either.  I emailed him wanting to bubble this up further.  He set up another phone appointment with me.  He made that one.  It lasted less than 5 minutes of him saying (paraphrasing here) ""do you want a refund or not.""  Basically, he was kicking me off of the mountain for his staff's refusal to honor their sale.

This incident was the last straw.  I have been to the mountain before and dealt with the exceptionally rude ""Old Man Miami"" as other riders know him.  I also witnessed bartenders serving blatanly drunk folks, patrons way beyond reasonably inebrieated, which is against Montana law.  These drunken folks then hit the slopes with no one stopping them.  However, if you dare not have a leash on your snowboard, you will be stopped and berated.

Don't bother with this place.  Go elsewhere where staff knows what they are doing and actually enjoy being there.  Go somewhere that is not as icy as these slopes.  Bridger is leaps and bounds better."
Yelp,Red Lodge,1/29/12,negative,3,"Decent place to snowboard for the area. Cheap lift tickets, but slow ski lifts.

Although, i still had a good time the ski lift guy ""ronnie"" was very rude to myself and a lady with 2 kids. I was very surprised that a small local place like this would have employees that treated there first time customers like that.

Next time i'm in the area i will surely drive the extra hour to Bigsky area.

Oh beware!! Montana law! You need to have a ""leash"" attaching you and ur snowboard while your on the ski lift."
Yelp,Discovery,1/10/22,negative,1,"Myself along with my group of 6 people will never

Yelp,Discovery,1/16/22,negative,2,We bought tickets and lessons for our 12 year old daughter. Due to Covid we had to postpone our trip for one week. Management would not reimburse us. Poor customer service.
Yelp,Discovery,2/16/19,negative,1,Don't do kinderski unless you want your child to stand around for two hours. No one bothered to call the next day to discuss this concern as they said they would. Discussed with the owner and he made me feel bad for calling. Terrible experience. Do not recommend unless you want instructors to make your kid cry then ignore them. Incredible waste of money with the worst customer service and complete disregard for the well being of children I've ever experienced.
Yelp,Discovery,1/21/14,negative,2,"The skiing is OK at Discovery, but probably not worth what they charge for a full day adult lift ticket. The snowpack is marginal year after year. It's low elevation and often gets some of the least amount of snow anywhere. When it does get a good dump, and if there happens to have a good base, the backside is some of the steepest and best skiing around. There are also a few fun cruiser runs. 

Beware when buying certain ticket products from these folks. Last year we bought a ""five pack"" of lift tickets that had ""no restrictions"" and were ""transferable."" I wasn't clear on whether they expired or not, so I called Discovery and asked the girl who answered if the five packs expired at the end of the season. I was told they did not. In fact my receipt for the purchase had all kinds of information about tickets, expiration dates for season passes, etc. but said nothing about the five pack expiring at the end of the season. The literature at the ski hill also says nothing about the five packs expiring at the end of the season. 

However, after driving more than 150 miles, when we went to redeem two of our three remaining tickets we were told that the tickets had expired. So our $160 got us two adult lift tickets. Big Sky rates! 

When I talked to the manager of the hill about this, he insisted that nobody there told me that the five packs didn't expire. He then went on to explain that they were counting on the fact that people like me wouldn't use all five of our purchased ski tickets. It seemed to me he was admitting that they were intentionally vague about the expiration so as to take advantage of people like me. I asked him if we could work something out, since I was told that they didn't expire. I offered to pay the difference between the increase in the price of the five pack if he'd honor the three remaining tickets on our pass, he scoffed at me and offered to sell me five tickets for $200, which is the normal adult rate.  

The manager was completely unwilling to take responsibility for an employee's assurances to me and instead essentially called me a liar, belittled me and went out of his way to be rude and insulting. 

There are definitely better choices for skiing out there. I know I won't be supporting this business again. I'll take my money, my bar tab, and my friends to a place that respects its customers."
Yelp,Discovery,1/31/17,negative,1,"After mistakenly buying a lift ticket verses a college spring pass at Discovery, we asked to trade it in and pay the difference. We had the pass around 1 hour before realizing our mistake. But the manager said no & wouldn't budge one inch.  Praying that this poor dud gets some badly needed training in customer service as his comments were belittling!"
Yelp,Discovery,2/14/16,negative,1,"For the price, long lines and the poor customer service I won't be returning not worth it!"
Yelp,Whitefish,2/23/21,negative,3,"Beautiful views and ski runs.  Was quite cloudy with low visibility and icy ski conditions at times, especially when using chair lift #1. Must take blue runs to get to green trails if taking lift #1 & #2. Stayed at Edelweiss with nice views, kitchenette and hot tub. Snow bus also a nice perk to go into town.
A few concerns with the workers at the resort. One of the ski lift workers had gloves that said 'inspired to be a dirt bag'. Dan in the base lodge rental area was very rude when we asked about our ski pass not working at night (the 3day pass says nothing about night skiing being excluded from the pass). Lastly, on Sunday when standing in line waiting for ski lift #1 to open, an off-duty youth ski instructor from the resort was in line next to us (Isiah S. from NC) was making threats towards the tourists, saying 'is tourist season open yet? Can we start shooting them yet? When are these chickens gonna fly back to their coop?' He was also threatening to throw coins at people's helmets and had a laser that he was pointing in people's eyes.He was very loud and obnoxious and made sure everyone knew he was an employee at the resort. He even was purposely standing on the back of our skiis. NOT cool.
They are also big sticklers with face masks, even though the state  has lifted the mandatory use. Face masks even needed to be worn outside.
It was good trip, but had better experiences at Big Sky, Keystone, Breckenridge, and Copper Mt."
Yelp,Whitefish,8/21/21,negative,1,Staff training recommended- save yourself the frustration.
Yelp,Whitefish,4/19/21,negative,2,Lodging- morning eagle. Easy access to ski lift. Amenities were dated. Limited local dining spots.
Yelp,Whitefish,1/1/20,negative,1,"Worst lift line corrals in the business, and now they're ripping off locals for parking. They won't stay open past tourist season because the tourists go away, and you always have to worry about plowing an uphill skier in the fog."
Yelp,Whitefish,2/14/20,negative,3,"Great mountain, small lift line, snow ghosts, (relatively) reasonably priced lift tickets and lodge food. Unfortunately, the ski rentals at the base lodge were a major detraction. My girlfriend is a beginner and our experience was abominable. The girl ""helping"" us got our rental form, grabbed some boots, dropped them in front of my girlfriend and walked away. Fortunately I worked is ski shops in my 20's and knew how to fit boots so I made sure her size was correct, switched her insoles and got her fit and properly buckled. The guy who got her skis asked no questions, just checked her boot sole size and handed her skis with no explanation. The skis were dry but ok and I made sure her poles were the correct size which they didn't bother to do. I don't know if it's poor management, poor training or just ambivalence about the job from gen z young adults but I remember when customer service and caring about helping new skiers in a sport that workers are passionate about was a thing. I would recommend the Sportsman and Ski Haus in Whitefish, they seem to have a better reputation, better prices and certainly couldn't be any worse, I don't think that is possible."
Yelp,Whitefish,9/5/16,negative,1,"Don't waste your time or money!! We booked a zip and stay package for our honeymoon and drove 600 miles and 2 states to do this. When we checked in the man at the Kintla lodge check in desk was horribly rude. Our room was ok, small with a queen bed but otherwise fine. They have a tiny hot tub that closes at 10pm and didn't re-open until 10 am. It smelled like rotten eggs

The zip tour had been rescheduled because of weather, which is awesome that they called and gave us a heads up. Luckily we opted for the refund and my husband was going to just book the next day if weather would cooperate.

When we woke up for the 10 am check out (really 10 am? Too early) the weather was better so we packed up, checked out to get a coffee next door at the village coffee shop. We literally walked up between 10:00 and 10:01 and the girl just looked at us and looked away talking to her boyfriend who was sucking down some drink. Apparently the stupid coffee shop closed at 10. Horrible that she didn't even try to say sorry we just closed or even point to the darn sign!

Next try was to go to the coffee shop at base lodge where he was going to do the zip line. We parked and got in there and couldn't find an open coffee shop, was passed by no less then 8 staff while looking. Not one of them would even help. When we walked by the mountain excursion room and the zip line check in every employee was staring blankly and not one of them were any help.

We left. Completely disappointed in our experience with this whole resort!! (Katie and Suzanne you are the only nice ones) Worst staff ever! Everywhere we went staff just treated us like we were putting them out by even being there. Both my husband and I have worked in many different roles with customer service and just cringe at this resort. Never has it been so hard to spend our money somewhere!!"
Yelp,Whitefish,3/14/13,negative,3,"his review is mixed and is more relevant to those traveling to the resort via Amtrak.

-- On mountain staff: 5 stars --
The staff here is amazing.  Super friendly and helpful.  My 9 yr old daughter kept saying throughout the day ""everyone is so friendly here"".   I had a lift operator come out of nowhere and offer to take a photo of me with my camera.  The ski instructors are great with children and after her first two hour lesson she was a much more confident skier and exchanging high fives with her instructor.

-- Wait times: 5 stars --
We stayed at Whitefish over a holiday weekend, MLK day, and they were also holding a big race.  It was their busiest weekend of the year and the longest line was only 10 minutes.   Most of the lifts are a minute or less, and some with no lines.

You can easily find runs that you will have almost to yourself.  The people at Whitefish are mostly locals or Canadian (no Europeans like at Whistler) and so it's a very low key atmosphere and people are courteous to each other.

-- Ski in Ski out: 3 stars --
The resort advertises ski in ski out access from their hotels and rental properties.  The ski out is super easy for both snow boarders and skiers.  However skiing back in is a challenge, especially with children.  In order to ski back in you have to traverse the lifts all the way to skiers right, and then take a fairly tough blue run to a long, fairly flat cat track.  There are no signs to tell you where you are going and we made a couple mistakes that required hiking back to the correct turn.

For you last run if the day it's brutal with children.  Adults that can ski blues well and have a good sense of direction will fair better.  This could be easily improved with some more signage and curing a green run higher up the mountain.

-- Other Activities: 2 stars --
We were attracted to Whitefish because they advertised activities like dogsledding and sleigh rides.  However, these activities are far from the resort and they are not supported with a regular shuttle service.  Dog sledding is 30 miles away and unless you have a large group and are going on a Tuesday, the you will need to pay for a cab - $50 each way.   Slight riding is only available to groups if 6 or more, so a family of 4 or a couple is out if luck.  

It's ridiculous - Whitefish needs to improve their shuttle service if they are going to market traveling by train.

-- Snow: 3 stars --
As of The third week in January, coverage isn't great.  There are bald spots all over the lower mountain.   It is nothing like Cascades in Washington where coverage is deep by January.  However, since it is very cold in Montana, the quality if the snow is great and hold up well.   We had no new snow our entire stay but it held up well to grooming and stayed fluffy (although packed down) off trail."
Yelp,Whitefish,2/17/19,negative,3,We loved the resort but were disappointed by the terrain. There is very little tree powder skiing due to trees growing close together. We found best powder on edges of blue runs under main chair. Most of those runs are not groomed so what we hoped would be powder on groomed was pow on moguls. Also the top is 6800 so it is like cascade snow but drier due to extreme cold. Back to colorado or utah next vacation unless they groom way more here. Lodging food staff fantastic!
Yelp,Whitefish,8/17/14,negative,1,"After hiking the Danny On Trail and starving, the Base Lodge Cafe was very disappointing. The buffalo burger, bacon, onions, and bun were all burnt (black) and not enjoyable. The onion rings were good and my boyfriend said the milkshake was good. But for a burger that's $13 (not including shake and onion rings) I would expect much better."
Yelp,Whitefish,3/17/12,negative,3,"Whitefish is a pretty decent mountain for beginner to advanced skiers.  It's very family-friendly, with a good variety of runs easily accessible from the main lift.  It's also a fairly big mountain, with four skiable peaks and more than eight lifts and t-bars.

During my visit, the weather was fairly warm and wet, but there was still some pretty great powder near the summit.  Some friendly locals showed me some great runs.  One required what I'd describe as a ""medium length"" hike, but the payoff was a spectacular stash of virgin powder on some great terrain.  Thanks, guys!

The resort itself is beautiful.  I was very impressed with the size, quality, and cleanliness of the room I stayed in.  That said, the bed was hard enough that it did give me some trouble sleeping, and for how many buildings there are in the ""village,"" there's surprisingly little selection in terms of food.

My review has been very positive so far, so you might wonder why I've only given Whitefish 3/5 stars.  Well, there are a few downsides.  First, although the mountain has a lot of skiable area, the vertical drop is only 2353 feet (717 meters.)  Compared to nearby mountains like Revelstoke, that's not great, and it's very evident in the runs.

While there is lots of good terrain to be found, the best spots are difficult to get to, and because there's so little vertical, the challenging terrain will only last you a couple minutes if you know what you're doing.  After that, you're stuck on long, slow, boring cat tracks to get back to the lift.  I really enjoyed Hellroaring Basin and the East Rim Face, but the former comes out at the bottom of a rickety old chair that takes forever to get back up the mountain, and the latter can be bombed down in a matter of seconds when the snow is good, only to leave you with a ten-minute slog across a mostly-flat green run.

My other complaint is that the resort staff don't seem to be super diligent about opening lifts on time and keeping guests informed about closures.  On the first day of my visit, the opening of the main chair was delayed by half an hour because rime from the previous night had to be cleaned off the seats.  I find that a little perplexing given that the chair normally opens at 9:30, which is already a half-hour later than every other resort I've ever been to.  Additionally, they didn't do a great job of communicating about the situation to the people waiting in line.  To be fair, ice-covered chairs are a safety issue and sometimes the weather causes unexpected surprises, so I'd readily forgive the staff for being a half hour late to open the chair one day.  

What I won't  forgive, though, is that on the second day the Bigfoot T-Bar was closed for no apparent reason, with no indication of its closure on any of the signs I looked at.  I know what you're thinking: why would you want to ride a t-bar anyway?  From what I understand (and from what I've seen of the area), the Bigfoot services some pretty respectable powder runs.  I was annoyed that I rode down to it twice only to find it closed.

To finish this ""compliment sandwich"" and summarize, I did enjoy my time at Whitefish, and it is a good resort.  Families will love it here, and if you're coming from southern Montana there's probably nothing better around.  However, if you're an expert skier or snowboarder--you eat black diamonds for breakfast and only start to work up a sweat when you're on a gnarly double-black--then you may find yourself growing bored of the mountain before too long.  If you're coming in from the Calgary area, there are a several better mountains within the same distance (for example, Kicking Horse and Revelstoke).  

Everyone should give Whitefish a try, but you might not want to book a week-long ski trip here if you're looking for seriously challenging terrain."
Yelp,Whitefish,7/21/13,negative,3,My family of 5 just stayed at the Sherpa in Whitefish for a few days with a goal of visiting Glacier.  The accomodations were very nice and there was plenty of room for us all. I don't know that it was worth the price but it was very nice.  (We loved being close to the pool.)  We loved going down the alpine slide and the Zipline the staff was very helpful. Everything on this mountain was pricey (especially for a slow summer day- and I bring tip cash with you).  Abbey and Jenny were awesome zipline guides!
Yelp,Whitefish,2/15/13,negative,1,"Very, very unhappy right now.  As a local, living in Kalispell, I've been taking my skibike to this resort for 10 years, and last sunday, after getting on the lift and taking a run, I was pulled aside just as I was getting ready to get on the lift, a 2nd time,  told they'd had a change in policy, and I was no longer allowed to use a skibike unless I also had short skis on my feet.  I wear Sorel type boots when I ride and always have so of course I can't hook into bindings and what's the point of the bike if you have skis on your feet too, you might as well just ski.  So, they refunded my money and sent me home.  1 big problem is, after all these years of allowing me full use of all lifts, say I'd invited a skibiker from outta state, they came with me, took a run, and were told ""uh, change in policy"".  Uh, wouldn't the outta stater be discouraged after, being told honestly ""Whitefish Mtn Resort has allowed me on the lift for 10 years"", spending money to come here and ...you get the idea.  Yes skibikes have not achieved the mainstream acceptance snowboards have, but remember back in the late 80""s when very few resorts allowed snowboards on the lift?  Over the years I have encountered liftees who were not familiar with skibikes, or me, and was sent home one evening after skiing for more than 2 hours.  I made a stink about it and the next day administration assigned 2 patrol to watch me get on and off the lift and ski 3 runs with me to see if I was a hazard.  Their conclusion was, no, my feet and boots never touch the ground when getting off the lift and I could ski with general traffic, keep up, and not create a hazard.  They apologized for the nite before, told me I was good to go and that was 7 years ago, no concerns or funny looks since then.  So imagine my disdain when, this season, after having already been up there with the skibike on New Years Eve, having the disappointment, and embarrassment, of being pulled aside just as I was about to get on the lift, being taken into the shack there, put on the phone with management and told I was done for the day.  Funny thing is, for YEARS, before the resort changed hands 5/6 years ago, they used to RENT skibikes.  Yes they were awful, clunky things and you were supposed to have skis on your feet also, but...My how things change.  So.  Being that Blacktail Mountain locally has allowed me to spend my money there with no hassle for 10 years, I believe I will have to grace their slopes with my unique sport.  bummer.  I have included a pic here of me taken at Whitefish Mtn Resort on my skibike.  This resort needs to appreciate the locals more.  WE ARE THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY PAY YOUR WAY.  facebook.com/photo.php?f…"
Yelp,Bridger,2/28/21,negative,3,"I actually really liked this skiing area. I got reservations four days prior. There weren't a lot of people compared to other resorts. For us, we were happy to have the great selection of greens and blues. This is a no frills place and didn't break the bank like a day of skiing usually does.

The staff for the most part were fantastic. With two notable exceptions and why I can't give a better review.

1) When picking up the ski cards in an outside window, the man in the booth was very rude to the woman in front of me..... ""Put your mask up"". So she did. ""Over your nose"". Keep in mind this guy was behind a glass window. And she was outside. Ick. He was nice to me since I had my nose covered with my scarf. Ridiculous.

2) I was with my younger son, getting on the Sunnyside lift. We don't ski all the time so at first it's hard to get your bearings with all the equipment. They had a mask bouncer at the beginning of the entrance of their ""masked zone"". My son was told to keep his mask over his nose. Which he tried but it loosened literally right when we were about to get on the lift. This guy walked over to my kid (who was on the end to my left) , right when we were about to board, so my son was distracted and I ended up going alone. I was yelling that he shouldn't go alone. So he went up with another family. Let's talk about this........ We were near no one at that point. Outside. Is it safer for my kid to go up with me or another family? And let's talk about safety. Shouldn't he be thinking about getting on the lift safely?

This sh** has to stop. I'm not sure if these people are just drunk on authority but that was out of hand. While everyone else was fantastic, this just pissed mama bear off. Yeah, you.... Dude in the lime green jacket at Sunnyside. Are you waiting for someone to get physically hurt on a lift for this to stop??? I'm shocked this type of thing is happening in Montana. I'm tired of the maskholes."
Yelp,Bridger,4/13/21,negative,2,"We were laughing and having fun, terrain is good! The Snow is a little heavy though (coming from Utah). Then ski patrol kicked us out for having a beer, which I NEVER thought would happen at a ski resort. Even in a place as strict as Utah that would never happen! Kind of blew my mind and definitely ruined our experience. Will only be go to Big Sky from now on. At first I was wondering why it was so empty, after that incident with the employees, I understand."
Yelp,Bridger,12/15/20,negative,1,"Bridger bowl is an amazing place. Current winter conditions are not ideal. That being said, the current management has decided to take it upon themselves to restrict access to an outdoor recreation area to a specific number of people.  Not completely restricting indoor areas to those who do make the cut for daily reservations.  As for reservations, I'm not surprised that all 750 allotted spots went in a matter of hours.  Let's just see if the whole season will go that way.  Maybe they should be looking at how other resorts of similar size are operating in the area(Grand Targhee, Discovery).  Maybe stop all day pass sales instead of restricting season pass holders from doing something they paid for months in advance.   But I forgot they changed their mission statement from ""First to the residents of Gallatin County; second to the citizens of the State of Montana; and, third, to areas out-side Montana, and to do so at the lowest prices consistent with good business practice such as to allow the continued healthy operation of Bridger Bowl. ""  to ""to plan, develop and maintain facilities and services in a financially sound manner which provide the best possible skiing experience at a reasonable cost to local, regional and destination skiers"". Slight change of words big difference in who they are catering to.  Just a thought, wouldn't you want less people from out of state(day passes) skiing at the resort if they potentially are carrying covid and bringing it to a less infected Montana population(season passes).  I would rather the resort be closed for the season if your goal is to protect employees, that would make sense.  And if not,  just keep it open with whatever mask, social distancing policy they deem necessary.  Don't make the decision for people, if you are fearful of Covid than don't go skiing at a resort learn some avalanche safety skills and go into the backcountry where covid can't get ya. Some people cherish these seconds outside and their mental health might even need it.  Don't take it away from them, allow them to make that decision for themselves."
Yelp,Bridger,10/26/17,negative,1,I really love this mountain. But the fact that they keep raising their prices every year really shows what's important to them. This is a college town! Wake up! Do you think people are made of money here? Stop feeding the greed
Yelp,Bridger,4/7/18,negative,1,"Watch out for Jeff the ski patrol asshole on the mountain!!!! He is THE WORST. He ruins lives and takes passes from skiers who are just trying to have a good time. On closing day today my friend jumped over a rope, there was nothing to say ""no jumping"" or anything so how was he supposed to know that his day would end by being escorted down the mountain by Jeff, the rudest ski patrol you will ever meet. My friend Noah was being very nice and understanding towards Jeff and was unaware that he made a mistake. However Jeff was so rude he made my friend noah cry and ruined his day, he told him he was happy to see him leaving the mountain and that he never wants to see him again. He very easily could have given Noah a warning but instead he took his pass and he won't get in back until 3 weeks into NEXT ski season. Noah could have easily out skied jeff the asshole but instead was kind and understanding and in return Jeff yells at Noah and ruins his whole day. Nobody deserves to be treated as badly as noah was today. If anyone reads this that works at Bridger ski patrol I hope you fire Jeff."
Yelp,Bridger,5/14/09,negative,3,"If you're from Bozeman how are you NOT gonna ski here?  However, I'm not so sure it lives up to its self-proclaimed status of a ""world-class ski resort.""  A great regional spot that would be a real standout in any area outside of the Intermountain West.  But when you have Big Sky and Jackson Hole within a few hours drive it's easy to overlook this local favorite.  They avoid high-speed lifts here like the plague and for the longest time you had to HIKE UP to the top of famed Ridge.  They are constantly expanding however and like I say, if you're in Bozeman, how are you NOT gonna come here?"
On the Snow,Whitefish,21st September 2020,negative,1,We snowboarded at night on Feb 16/ 2020 and during the day on the 17th. Lots of fresh snow and the condition was great both during the day and night! 
On the Snow,Whitefish,21st February 2019,negative,3,3 out of 10 overall score terrible Resort worst management I've seen in the industry which is a total insult to the industry because nobody at this place is at actual industry Insider...

On the Snow,Whitefish,21st December 2009,negative,2,"I live in Florida and have been coming here since 1990.  I like Whitefish so much I ended up building a house here a few years back.  As a seasoned skier/snowboarder my numero uno top things to look for in a ski resort are 1.)  No lines... hence, more skiing, 2.)  No celebrities...yeah , that includes you, Jon Gosselin!  3.)  No Mink coat shops... see item #2.  If you want family atmosphere, it's here.  Want gourmet dinners in town and nightlife, it's here,  Want theater and shows with Broadway talent and facilities to match, it's here.  Not only that, try getting out of downhill for a day or afternoon and take a short drive to Glaicier national park and rent Xcountry skis to hear a splendid silence of the park that is almost deafening in our plugged in world.  The silence and wildlife might just amaze some of the naysayers out there who find  Whitefish a little too, umm, ""foggy"".  Go back to Aspen and Sun Valley, it won't offend the rest of us."
On the Snow,Whitefish,9th April 2009,negative,2,"If you like skiing this is a great place.  Great skiing all around good terrain, good snow, friendly town, and best of all you don't have to wait more than 5 minutes for a lift.  I've seen the complaints about weather but we've had pretty good luck with that.  When it is sunny the view can't be beat.  Really this place is one of my favorites.  We usually hit up Fernie and this palce on the same trip.  Both great mountains!"
On the Snow,Whitefish,11th June 2008,negative,2,"I agree with the last review, we have been coming for many years and my kids say the terrain park facilities are a big hit for them.  They prefer Snoqualmies park but they say the half pipe was a huge surprise to them.  It was better than any other pipe here in Washington.  Way to go Big Mountain.  The fog can be overwhelming at times but usually isn't to bad.  We will be back.       "
On the Snow,Whitefish,30th May 2008,negative,2,"I snowboard here because I like the lack of crowds, steep pitches, and crummy weather keeping the crowds down and the snow good.  Thank god for the socked in weather because otherwise we would have way to many people here and this actually would be a ""resort"".  For those who like to ski and snowboard come on out here and those who like to whine and compare here to there; go there instead this winter, you'll most likely get better weather, better service and better skiing.  Besides the summertime in Whitefish is really where its at. Incredible golf courses that are affordable, fishing, biking, rafting, hiking, long days...the list goes on.    "

Best snowboarding we have ever had. The St. Augustine Snowboard team had a blast. Edelweiss was a great place to stay and convientent to everything. Two lifts out our back door, one lift out the front. Bierstube next door, Ed & Mullys across the road. The people are extremely friendly. If your in town, make sure you hit up Powder Hour at Ed & Mullys.... $4 PBR pitchers. Can't wait to go back. "
On the Snow,Whitefish,6th January 2008,negative,1,"It's called Big Mtn for a reason, it's BIG.  So far this year it's also deep.  I haven't skied here long so I cannot fairly compare Whitefish management to Big Mtn management, but contrary to what Dec. 31 Anonymous says I am pretty sure that the did not mellow the terrain.  For the local haters, try to remember that they changed the name of the resort not the mountain.  Check out a USGS map, it's still called Big Mountain, always will be.  As long as the good Lord keeps us in the fog, try as they may, the Big will never become another Aspen.  Still big, still deep, still hometown friendly.  So please come out, have fun, go home and tell 10 friends it sucked, they should go somewhere else.  "
On the Snow,Whitefish,31st December 2007,negative,2,My gosh this place is amazing. I've never skied snow like I skied this week here. And the people are so friendly. 
On the Snow,Whitefish,26th December 2007,negative,2,"YES it is called BIG FOG MOUNTAIN FOR A REASON. The fog can stop you dead in your tracks!!! But when you get one of those clear days, the skiing, snowboarding and views are second to none!!!! The lodging is good and has good access to the lifts and a shuttle to take you were you need to go. There is also a free snow bus from whitefish that is convenient and has a fairly good schedule to and from the resort. The nightlife on the mountain is slim to none with the beerstube bar being the highlight. But if you‚Äôre looking for live music, whitefish has some music but the quality of bands has really taken a hit with the Great Northern booking low quality cheep acts. About a year or so ago, the local bands they were booking were excellent! But the all mighty dollar has taken its toll. DO YOU HERE THAT DOUG (owner of the Great Northern)!!!!!!!!!!"
On the Snow,Whitefish,30th May 2007,negative,3,"We found our mountain approx, 8 years ago on a last minute deal.  Our hotel named on arrival, turned out to be Grouse Mountain Lodge, probably the nicest hotel in our opinion, though there are many good ones.  First time we'd been to USA, previous two years Banff, otherwise Europe. Two weeks and we're hooked!  Return the following two years, staying at the Grouse.  Following year buying a home at Ptarmigan Village.  The mountain is beautiful, approx 4000 acres, stunning views, good runs catering for all. You want Powder there's lots of it!  See the Snow Ghosts!  Over the years we've seen a lot of development some good, some not so good.  Locals will tell you, ' they are trying to make it another Aspen', we hope not, though nothing against Aspen. We just fell 'in love' with the mountain, at any time of year, generally trying to make at least 2/3 visits per year.  This snow we're going for 3 months ski, how lucky are we! Whitefish is a quaint town, approx 6mls from ski village, free snowbus, couldn't wish for more, restaurants, bars, shops, everything you need and probably the nicest friendliest  people ever.

On the Snow,Snowbowl,2nd January 2020,negative,3,"I learned to ski here.  It‚Äôs hard on a new skier, but if you make it through you ski for life.  This is home to me so I love it.  My daughter learned here.  Just come, have a relaxed mom and pop Montana ski hill attitude and you‚Äôll love it."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,23rd January 2016,negative,3,"Disclaimer: Skiers may love this mountain far more than snowboarders. This is an excellent mountain with some serious problems of execution. When visiting snowbowl I would always be suspicious of their snow report. If you are a park person, I'm sorry, the website will continue to tell you there is a park when in fact the park is seemingly always closed. Even if you call and ask if it's open, and they say yes, you will get there to find it closed. Couldn't tell you why. 

Similarly, I have often found that they are only running one lift, with no good explanation why. The only place I've ever seen shut down a lift for wind in 15 mph winds. On a mountain.

For snowboarders: you are required to have a leash on your board. They won't tell you that until you get to the front of the - often long - lift line. You know, in case your foot completely disengages from your leg, which happens all the time. Nevermind all those ski ejections - those pose no real threat.

Now, on the plus side, the mountain itself is great. Great terrain, very easily accessed by well placed (if a little slow) lifts. Nice long runs, AMAZING sustained steeps and trees galore. When it gets the snow it's a blast. 

It's just my experience there has always been lacking. The staff are almost uniformly rude, as if it was part of their training. The drive up is truly a nightmare, at the end of which you find yourself parking on the side of the road 1/2 a mile from the lodge. Driving down is even worse.

To sum up, the fantastic terrain of this mountain manages to negate a seemingly endless list of reasons NOT to go to snowbowl. "
On the Snow,Snowbowl,25th February 2014,negative,3,"Snowbowl is a great place to ski, right next to Missoula.  I've been up 5 times already this year and the only time i have noticed a liftie being a ""Douche"" (as per previous review)  Is when someone is clearly being an idiot, and or rude to other snowbowlers.   They will slow the lift down so really little kids can get on safely, and on snow days they do their best to get as much snow off your seat before you sit down as possible. the only conversations i've had with lifties ended with a smile.
The owners are cool too, they just dropped a TON of money into improving the access road to snowbowl.

As far as the mountain itself goes, it's probably not a place for beginners, some of the stuff snowbowl labels as blue runs would be considered black diamonds at other rocky mountain ski areas.  some of the stuff Snowbowl lists as black diamonds would be either double black or ""out of bounds"" at other places.   If you know what your doing on skis or a board this is a fun mountain, if not i imagine a vast majority of the mountain would be well beyond your skill level.

Lift tickets are reasonable ($42), -- the lifts are a little old and a little slow, but seem to be maintained well (although i hear rumors of them going down every now and again) and the bar at the bottom of the hill has regular bar prices instead of ski resort prices, great brick oven pizza and plenty of beer to choose from."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,2nd December 2008,negative,3,"Snowbowl unfortunately only has two actual chair lifts with two more of the T lines. It's fun but the terrain is very limited and doesn't offer much diversity to skiers that are just starting out. Easy to see in a day, and fortunately doesn't yet have the big resort influence and prices (I paid 6 bucks for two slices of Pizza and a Drink) which is definitely a plus. I worked at Park City Mountain Resort and with a fifty percent discount on food couldn't get pizza that cheap, I was stoked, usually I have to take a backpack full of food (do it for the bigger resorts prices are ridiculous on food). It was overall a good experience, not really for beginners but if your an intermediate or expert skier the bowls just to the right of the second lift are pretty fun. Be ready for moguls and the most old school chair lift I've ever seen. "
On the Snow,Snowbowl,4th February 2008,negative,3,"Here is what the bowl is:
- The only ski area for folks from Missoula to ski w/o driving 150 miles round trip.
- A nice local area with a lot of terrain and vertical drop, as well as some of the best tree skiing around.  Seriously.  
- Two major storm tracks affect the area from the Pacific and unfortunately for the Bowl the storms mostly go south to the Bitterroot range or north to the Glacier park area.  
- Also unfortunately the majority of the mountain and all of the black runs face either due south or southwest (worst).  Especially in the beginning and ending of season the snow can be AWFUL.  (But with this said the snow can also be GREAT at anytime)
- There is some good hiking access from the area allowing good snow to be found almost anytime.  
- I skied here for 7 years and loved it.  This mountain breeds REAL skiers, you know, the ones who rip and don't bitch about conditions.  

Oh, and here is what the Bowl is not:
- A resort."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,7th January 2008,negative,1,"SnowBowl is wonderful on a powder day (but only for that day, once the sun comes out it is either slush or ice because most of the good runs are South facing.  Walk to the lifts and lodge for the first and last 3 weeks of the season because of low elevation and no snow at the base.  Other than unfriendly staff it is a great place and close to town.  I love it on powder days."
On the Snow,Snowbowl,3rd January 2008,negative,3,"Overall a fantasitc place to ski.  Friendly atmosphere, great terrain/vertical, quality food and convenient to town.  Since it is 200 miles roundtrip to any other local area from Missoula, I'll save the money on gas and spend the difference on the fantastic pizza, spend more time skiing and less time driving!"
On the Snow,Snowbowl,29th November 2007,negative,3,"The ""Bowl"" as the locals refer to it is definitely not overpriced...who can complain about less than $50 lift tickets?

On the Snow,Bridger,22nd December 2008,negative,3,"Bridger Bowl is what skiing/snowboarding is all about. If you are looking for a knock down drag out day on the mountain this is your place. There is a vast amount of space to utilize and there is always a lot of snow. The mountain is set up to where the beginner runs are seperated from advanced ones. (The beginner runs are all at the bottom) You can hike the ridge and enjoy some back country skiing if you have what is required. ALL of the profits go back into the mountain so tickets are cheap, lifts are always working, staff is friendly, and actualy the rentals are pretty good. The 2008/2009 features the opening more terrain as well.  I have been to Big Sky and honestly put it behind Bridger simply because this place always seems to have better snow, the prices are drastically better, and it is closer to Bozeman.  (Which is a great town with good people and a lot of fun. The main reason I gave this place a 4 star for nightlife) Give it a shot and experience what everyone at Big Sky is missing."
On the Snow,Bridger,8th February 2008,negative,3,Bridger Bowl is a nonprofit ski hill owned by the town of Bozemen.  It is a great value and a very fun place to ski. It has something for everyone.  It gets a ton of snow and there are lots of powder days.  There is not much of a terrain park.  All there is is like three box rails.  You can hike up to the ridge above the lifts to have some backcountry skiing if you have all the safty equiptment.  Overall its a great hill and I would definetly recomend it.

On the Snow,Discovery,13th February 2018,negative,3,"Over 2000 acres of terrain, small local crowds, and cheap lift tickets make this one of the best family-friendly resorts you'll ever find. It may have THE BEST beginner to intermediate terrain of any resort in the Rockies.  Your beginners don't have to be relegated to the bottom third of the mountain like at other resorts and your experts will stay entertained on the backside which is nearly all double-black diamond.  The resort has a nice little day lodge with a decent grill and food selection and a picnic area downstairs where you can pack your own cooler.  This resort ""gets it"" when it comes to families.  Jackson Hole and Big Sky are great, but they aren't three-times better than Discovery.  If money is no object, by all means, choose one of those resorts.  But if you're looking for a great and affordable mountain to ski throughout the season, it's hard to beat Discovery."
On the Snow,Discovery,3rd January 2008,negative,3,Awesome steeps on the backside. Great ski area where you can ride the lift with the owner of the area.  We have had season passes up there for a couple of years and it just gets better and more fun each time we go.  Discovery is the bomb!!!!!!!!
On the Snow,Red Lodge,21st January 2019,negative,1,"I'm all about having fun on a mountain but I'm in my 30's now and that means I expect certain features. This place is okay if you're in a time crunch or can't travel very far from Billings, but other than that it isn't worth it. "
On the Snow,Red Lodge,16th November 2017,negative,1,"I hate to bash a ski resort, where I agree with the other reviewers ""everyone is very nice,"" but sadly that is where the compliments end for me.  They haven't built a new lift in 20 years it seems, the doubles + triples creep @ a snails pace.  The base area infrastructure needs an overhaul and a serious clean, the bathrooms are terrible.  I got food poisoning from the base area restaurant.  I recognize they can't help snow conditions, but they could at least do an average job of grooming what they have ....  for example one run was groomed for the first 200 yards (poorly), then left untouched for another 300 yards, then groomed the rest of the way down.  For a $55 lift ticket in MT, I'd ski Whitefish 10 out of 10 ten days.  You can also ski Mt Hood, Bridger Bowl, Grand Targhee or a handful of similarly sized resorts and have a far better day.  Until RML comes out of its time warp, I see no reason to come back."

On the Snow,Red Lodge,16th January 2016,negative,1,"We hit Red Lodge Mountain a couple times a year and always have a good time. Not the biggest ski hill, but there's plenty of mountain to keep you busy and the prices are fair. Plus, the town of Red Lodge is awesome. Great bars and food. "
On the Snow,Red Lodge,1st December 2009,negative,1,"I've skiied there for the first time last year. And I met two young men who work there as ski patrollers . I sparked up a conversation with them and told them I was a front range skiier from Colorado. And asked if there were good runs comprable to Summit Counties here? They looked at each other, nodded knowingly to themselves and took me skiing through the trees and glades way off to the skiers left. It was quiet, serene and beautiful and the snow was like butter. It was fantastic!  The open runs over there were also steep, narrow and excellent. I couldn't believe how uncrowded it was.And the Quad lift line was non-existant all day long. What a gem!

Later that year, during spring break it snowed an incredible amount (3 to 4 feet in 24 hours) and once I heard about that I drove like a madman from Bismarck, and rented an inexpensive hotel that was very nice. I think it was called The Chalet. And the next morning I drove up the accesss road to Red Lodge. But it was miserably slow from all the snow that had fallen. The road was littered with all types of front wheel and rear wheel drive vehicles spewn all over the road. But that didn't dampen my spirits. And that shouldn't dammpen your's either. We just have to leave earlier next time it snows. Alas, the snow fall was too much for the staff to handle that day.And the double black runs I  had skiied earlier that season wern't open. That was a fluke snow storm though. And no amount of help that day could have opened up those runs. 

But take it for what it's worth. Those two guys I met who worked for the ski patrol wern't lying when thay said to me ""This is the best skiing in Montana when we have snow"" and boy were they right. By all means go to Red Lodge. But mostly go to Red Lodge when it's snowing. You won't be dissapointed. And hopefully mother nature will cut you some slack!"
On the Snow,Red Lodge,29th January 2008,negative,1,"I love Redlogde Mountain!  I have been riding for 15 years and my mom and dad would take me there when I was 5.  We have very good snowmaking equipment and I have seen a great improvment with the coverage of man-made snow.  I think those of us who love REAL snow should pray to the mountain gods that they dump on Redlogde!  There is nothing like riding in fluffy drifts of powder.  I was hoping when I got my season pass this year they would tell me Lazy M would be open on December 1st, instead they told me they hope to have Turnpike open. I know they will do there best to get M open soon.  I really wish they had snowmaking equipment on the backside and also had a high speed quad from the bottom to the top of Grizzly Peak.  Less chair lift time would be great!    
 Overall, I feel blessed to be 1 hour away and be able to get to a mountain with snow (even if it is man-made).  It is nice to just get out and get some fresh air and relieve some stress.  I have been to Big Sky and Bridger many times (they too have ruff times with their snow).  They are great places too but a long drive from billings.  It pretty much spoils you going to Big Sky.  But then you really do see several people who reek of richness and they let it be known! Can anyone say,""STUCK UP!"" 
The people in Redlodge and on the Mountain make Redlodge Ski resort a great place for family fun sking and snowboarding.  

thankyou redlodge mountain for all you do to keep all us skiers and snowboarders happy!  Us passholders really appreciate it! 
Things could be worse!  We may not even have a ski/snowbaord mountain 10 years from now! I think we all better enjoy what we have while we have it.  Its getting warmer and warmer every year and shorter and shorter winters! 

Please let it snow!

On the Snow,Red Lodge,21st November 2007,negative,3,"I need to respond to the rock dodge dude. Up until about the first part of February, I think RLM had the best snow out of the 3 E. Moatanas (B.S., Bridger & RLM). I went to Bridger when they claimed they had 36"" of snow, it was 12"" in the trees and 3"" on the runs at best (never blame the starving though), at least RLM nevered lied. Big Sky wasn't even in the picture at the time, I dare you to ask.
I hold a season pass at RLM, why you ask???? Well for about $300 if you purchase it early, one can quickly find themselves skiing for free, isn't that the idea? I have never ski'ed the backside bottom of RLM.
Doesn't matter! I've been skiing rock dodger dude and not complaining. RLM is a great place here in Eastern Montana, I always wish snow upon them.
Remember when in Rome buddy.
If you can't fix your own ski's, I'll do it for a beer and a good conversation. 
RLM is close and I like to ski, isn't that the point? Last Saturday was the best day of the year so far.

On the Snow,Red Lodge,16th February 2007,negative,3,"MUST have breakfast at The Red Lodge Cafe!  The Pancakes are world class!

Lunch at Midway is O.K. the views make up for lack of menu,  Bierstube is much better.

Lazy M  is my favorite run. Especially on the weekends when the midway express chair is open."
On the Snow,Red Lodge,4th February 2007,negative,3,"Red Lodge has been a Family tradition since 1988.  In that time we have seen many great changes to RLM.  Family Favorites have been:

1. Yodeller Motel : Your room door goes directly outside but the steam baths and hot tub are great.  

2.  Old Piney Dell at Rock Creak Resort : Awsome.

3.  Bogart's Margarita's

4.  Jagermeister Shot's at Snow Creak!!

5.  Best of All The Spring Carnival.  Watching Cardboard and Duct Tape slide down Show Off Alley is the best!"
On the Snow,Red Lodge,21st January 2019,negative,1,The crowds are almost always thinned out by Waterville and Loon.  Also the mountain doesn‚Äôt have condos or hotels very near which also helps with crowds.  After a storm there are few mountains in the Northeast that can compare to Cannon; it‚Äôs as tough as you want it to be.  True skiers mountain with very little frills.
On the Snow,Showdown,15th March 2011,negative,3,"Showdown is probably one of the best. i've been skiing there since i was 5 and now am just learning to snowboard at the age of 16. its great for teens because they have a bus that takes us up everyweekend and we can create our own runs through the trees. all of our hidden jumps, runs, tree rails, and spots where the powder is so deep you just sink down and cant get out make it a funn and enjoyable time."
