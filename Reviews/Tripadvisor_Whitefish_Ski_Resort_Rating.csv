Tripadvisor,Whitefish Mountain Resort,January 2017,5,I love Big Mountain for ski-ing or snowboarding. It is one of the most economical mountains to ski/ride and everyone on the mountain is very friendly. Ski in / ski out is the way to go - it also gives you an excuse to go into town for a meal!

Tripadvisor,Whitefish Mountain Resort,March 2017,4,"Whitefish is known for its good snow, but I had not known there was so much diversity in its terrain.

Tripadvisor,Whitefish Mountain Resort,February 2017,4,"Do you need to *really* get away from it all?

Tripadvisor,Whitefish Mountain Resort,July 2017,4,Quite a line up for the ski lift but moving immediately if you chose the gondola.
