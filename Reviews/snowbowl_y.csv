Y,1,Snowbowl,Abby B.,Florida,10/21/20,5,"Zip-line : 
The staff were awesome. If I remember correctly it was Hannah & Garret.. I am not sure honestly. They were amazing and definitely deserve a raise. When we first began our adventure, a member of someone's group was removed because they were highly intoxicated.  I was thankful for it because the man made my group uncomfortable. I had zip-lined before from tree top to tree top so I expected it to be that way. It was NOT. I repeat it was NOT. I should first warn you that if you do not like roller coaster that have drops in them, this zip-lining is not for you. I myself do not like roller coaster like that so I was in for a rude awakening.  So, the very first zip line was a short hike away from the entrance but it very steep. My only complaint about this hike is there was no time to catch your breath before getting on the zip line. Also, there was no water or drinks given. It was in the high 80s on the day we went. Anyhow, once you are on the line, they make you show them the moves you learned for flying.  I liked the idea of it but I did not like that you had kinda hang over the side (you are harnessed in but it was still scary). The first line was pretty short so I did not really decide if I liked it or not. After your whole group goes you hike up to the second line. It's not a bad hike but it is kind of long. Once I got to the second zip-line, I knew that this zip-lining was not for me. Once they got me all hooked in, I could not make myself lift my legs to begin my descent down the line. I should have turned back then because once you get that far there is no turning back. So, I did the second line and HATED it. I hated to feel like I was falling and could not slow myself down. Well, I could not turn back. So, I did the last two lines and hated them just as much as the first two because of the drop feeling you get when coming down the line.

Ski lift:
After zip-lining we did the ski lift.  I would like to give it 4 stars because the operator who was supposed to slow the lift down and give some kind of direction did not. When we walked up, we asked to get a squirt of his hand sanitizer bottle and he acted like an asshole about it.  Then, when we went to get on the lift he didn't tell us nothing after showing him the ticket.  He went back to reading his book. So, the process of getting on the lift was funny because it scooped us up at full speed and then we were laughing trying to figure how to get situated while we were getting lifted through the pulley system and bouncing around. The lift itself was a little questionable because there was a lot of creaking and squeaking noises throughout our journey around it. But, it was really long & relaxing. I would definitely say it was worth the money to ride. Also, the same man who was an asshole during the getting on process did not slow the lift or direct us on how to get off. We made a quick dash off while still going fast and almost fell because we were trying to use a wooden step thing & not get hit by the next chair. But, overall it was a great trip."
Y,2,Snowbowl,Chris H.,Illinois,7/22/18,5,July 2018 did the zip line tour on all 4 zip lines. Short hike at the start and had a great time zip lining. Guides were very nice. Ended the tour with pizza which was the best. Dusty gravel drive up to Snowbowl.
Y,3,Snowbowl,Suzanne W.,Maryland,7/14/18,5,"Took the 4:30 tour today with my running boos and had a great experience. There are 4 lines all different levels. After the first line we hiked about a mile to the next one. Lines 3 and 4 were easy walks. Three instructors were absolutely fantastic. I personally think they all deserve raises! Anyway, I had a great time and will definitely recommend this place to my other running friends before the weekends over!"
Y,4,Snowbowl,Caroline Y.,Montana,4/5/14,5,"I've got the Snowbowl Love, and here's why: 
* this the real deal: the frequent/addicted/passionate skiers' hill
* rustic and comfortable
* wide variety of runs, something for all skiers -intermediate to expert (beginners will  probably be happier at Discovery, but learn more quickly at Snowbowl)
* friendly lifties, staff and instructors
* excellent food- they are known for their variety of great food and microbrews,  Bloody Marys and wood-fired pizza. 
* reasonably-priced lift tickets
* excellent ski programs
* ""Make friends, not lift lines."" (Jon-Jon) is the attitude 
* great community- fun, friendly and courteous
* professional, responsive and friendly ski patrol
* 15 minutes from Missoula

UPDATE 3/2016: we stayed at the hotel last night and can't wait to do it again! The rooms were modest but very clean and comfortable; the beds and linens are new and cozy. The kitchen is super convenient, although the restaurant was accommodating so we didn't need to cook. The hot tub was clean and hot; everything worked as expected; the bathrooms were clean; and the games and condiments in the kitchen were a nice touch. Everyone was super friendly and helpful...overall a very positive experience!"
Y,5,Snowbowl,Brodie B.,Montana,7/26/17,3,"A group of 5 had made plans to try the zip lines at Sowbowl. Based on our group size and the time of day, as their recording said to leave a message. We left no less than 4 messages over the span of 3 days. Not once did a single employee bother to call us back to confirm that our requested time was okay. We did show up and they were wonderful to us. The experience was fun but a tad slow due to the group of nearly 20. Nothing special that I have to go back for more. Appreciate the staffs friendliness and safety."
Y,6,Snowbowl,Diana G.,Montana,12/30/17,4,My favorite ski place great terrain and the bar is awesome!  Snow can sometimes be iffy but that's the challenge!  Lifts definitely a combo downside and upside....limited uphill capacity means more powder turns all day!  Unfortunately they seem pretty unreliable and break down more than the average bear....
Y,7,Snowbowl,Terry M.,New York,8/23/15,1,"I wasn't allowed on the zipline tour because of my weight.  That's fine, but my group should have been refunded.  The weight requirement is barely featured on the website, and not at all featured on the waiver--the employees at Snowbowl even admitted they've been trying to convince their boss to make it more prominent.  (I can promise you that their policy of not giving refunds is a lot more prominently featured.)  The best the boss (I think it was Nick?) could say was that they couldn't up the weight maximum without increasing the minimum too, which I guess would interfere with all the 60-pounders trying to ride.

So thanks for ruining our Friday afternoon, and I especially enjoy being called out for being a fatass in front of all your customers."
Y,8,Snowbowl,Andrew P.,Alaska,7/17/16,4,"This is a review for the zip line tour which has only been in operation for three years. We've only been on a zip line at big sky so not a lot to compare it to, but we definitely had a great time at Snowbowl. 

Andy who runs the zip line program is very professional, friendly and definitely enjoys his work. Reservations are easy to make online and email confirmation provided easy directions from Missoula to the mountain.  

The guides definitely enjoy their work as well and were professional, encouraging and got us going quickly. The zip line allows you to go two at a time, so it is a lot of fun to go with a friend or a party. The landing platforms are also nicely designed with counterbalance spring stops which make coming into the landing smoother and more comfortable than the lines at Big Sky. One of the neat things about snowbowl is that you only have to hike up one short quarter of a mile hike and you get three long rides with one short introductory line. Definitely a great time and well worth the $39 for cost.

Also definitely recommend stopping in at the bar afterwords as the deck is beautiful, relaxing, and the drinks are affordable. Definitely a great way to spend the day with the family in Montana."
Y,9,Snowbowl,Logan R.,Montana,2/1/18,5,"Love this place. Can't beat a 25 minute drive from south Missoula.  Nice tree runs. Only downside for some folks is the poor facilities, but I don't mind. My whole family loves it there"
Y,10,Snowbowl,Emily D.,Oregon,1/27/13,5,"I don't ski or snowboard but I did get married at Snowbowl a couple of summers ago and had a blast.  My friends and I relaxed the next day with cocktails in hand, professional chairlifting through the late summer afternoon.

I am writing this review because Snowbowl has the BEST Bloody Marys and brick-oven pizza in the Zoo...furthermore, the food at our wedding was exceptional.  I highly recommend Snowbowl for ultimate summer enjoyment just minutes from downtown Missoula.  One thing:  I would stay away from the wings...they just aren't crispy enough; maybe if the cooks made them more crispy they would be delicious."
Y,11,Snowbowl,Kerri M.,Montana,12/16/16,4,"My husband really enjoys their mountain biking trails in the summer and the skiing trails in the winter.  Their chair lifts commonly break down, leaving riders stuck for long periods of time. They need to be upgraded. Their food is delicious. I'm a big fan of their pizza and hummus. Full bar is available. I have had several friends do their zipline and all had a great experience. The road can be sketchy to drive but a shuttle service is available."
Y,12,Snowbowl,RJ D.,Pennsylvania,2/25/12,5,"Great place to ski, the access road was improved this year so it's a little bit less death defying to get up on powder days.   most of snowbowl is not for new skiers though, but if you like challenging expert terrain snowbowl is a great ski area.  
only two lifts so if you want to get to some of the further our terrain make sure you've got a fresh coat of wax on your skis, otherwise it can be a bit of work."
Y,13,Snowbowl,Bld D.,Washington,7/22/15,3,"This review is for the new zip lines. for comparison I have been on a number of these throughout the western hemisphere. I think whoever taught the workers may have been overly cautious, but while the lines where fun and nice and long and high, you can not enjoy the ride. 
on all others we've been on, the instructions were similar in going fast or slowing down, you were able to what you wished. 
on these you had to watch the landing crew and go into high drag mode when the signaled you hence not being able to enjoy the views or speed at your leisure. the stopping system was identical to others we have experienced but could land at any speed. 
also the hike to the second line is grueling. other places have had some kind of transport up the hill like a surplus military transport or the like. 
the price point is correct for what you get with the exception of the lack of transport. 
the pizza was good but needs more sauce."
Y,14,Snowbowl,A W.,California,11/2/07,4,"At the end of a long and winding dirt road (usually covered in snow) lies one  of most authentic (rustic) and fun ski areas I have ever been too. The mountain consists of 2 lifts, one to the 3/4 way mark and then one to the top. The weather up here can get ridiculous when a storm moves in and is not recommend in extreme cold. The view of the Valley is amazing as is the view of the Bitteroot Range, Mission Range and other less know Rockies Mountain Peak. If you want to get a little extra in, ski off the back and hike up to the ""Death Star"" for super fresh tracks. The lodge at the bottom is semi-new and serves great food. Careful on the way home as ""Bartenders Bend"" has claimed more than a few cars in its day."
