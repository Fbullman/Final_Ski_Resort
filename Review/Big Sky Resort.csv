We decided to come a day early so we booked a room at the resort. His company cancelled the conference due to rising COVID numbers 5 days prior to the start. We called to cancel the room we booked for one night and were advised that we won’t be refunded as rooms are non refundable within 14 days of the reservation. So frustrating and disappointing!

Incredible location and great friendly staff. Careen at the Base Camp is the MVP. She was able to book us some activities even though we failed to schedule them in advance of our arrival.
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or10-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,you pay for the views,Aug 2021,"Stayed at the HUNTLEY LODGE and it was gorgeous. we will be back after the renovations again but for now it's a little bit worn out, light bulbs in our room was dead, door to bathroom was stuck, shower is way to short (I'm 5.11 and didn't fit!) etc. But they made up for it with a gorgeous view and a fabulous free breakfast! thank you. You should spend more time here and take the free lift up, we didn't know about it and had run out of time already as the lift service only starts at 10 am so it would have taken too much of our time! wish we knew of this ahead of time."
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or10-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,"Surprised stores were closed, fewer activities for kids",Aug 2021,"So having been to Snow King and Teton Village/ Jackson Hole, as well as Heavenly Resort in CA/NV - we were expecting a similar experience at Big Sky Resort. We were so hopeful driving in - the area is huge with many homes, golf courses, and little shopping areas along the way. At the end of the road is the Resort itself and maybe half of the stores and restaurants were closed. They have a climbing wall and an acrobatic/elastic sling contraption, as well as a portable putt-putt golf (this was in rough shape) which would work well for little ones. There were a TON of mountain bikers - this seems to be the activity at the Resort. We spent about 2 hours there- 1.5hr for lunch (expect long wait times since there are fewer restaurants open) and 30 minutes walking around making sure we weren't missing anything."
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or10-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,Bring necessities with you,Jul 2021,"What a beautiful resort. However, I have stayed at Super 8s that treated their guests better. We spent 5 days at Big Sky Resort recently for a medical conference. However, the resort was not ready for guests. We went 24 hours without toilet paper after our first request for some. The water was undrinkable in all the guest rooms (an employee advised) not just our room. The tv, telephone and room safe didn't work. With the telephone being nonfunctional, we had to go to the front desk to make our requests and wait with multiple others to make requests for toilet paper, trash bags, clean towels, etc. One hot tub was not working and the other hot tub only had 2 working jets. The housekeeping staff was MIA even for small requests - we didn't expect daily room cleaning. The staff were friendly but not very interested in fixing any of the problems. All of this for a high price of $300 per night. There are many other places to stay in the area, so I would recommend a place that provides toilet paper and drinkable water. The Big Sky area was beautiful and we will likely visit that area again, but will find alternate accommodations."

https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or10-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,Big Sky Action,Jul 2021 • Couples,"We used our timeshare to book a week in Big Sky. Very windy roads took us to the resort area. The area was beautiful. We took the ski lift to the top of the mountain. You were also able to use the lift to bring mountain bikes to the top and bike down the hill. Lift tickets were around $35 for the day. We were there in July, it is a major ski spot in winter. We went to a Chuckwagon dinner and show. Big Sky had a rodeo on our last night. That was a lot of fun. This resort is only an hour from Yellowstone, so it is very convenient!"
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or10-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,ZIPLINE ADVENTURE,Jun 2021,Mike and Cole were SO fun to zipline with on the Adventure Zipline! It was shorter than we expected (4 ziplines) but being with them was so fun!
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or10-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,Five star scenery and so much to see and do!,Jun 2021 • Family,"We really enjoyed our recent stay at Big Sky Resort. The scenery is spectacular. One highlight of the trip was spotting so much wildlife on our daily hikes. We stayed at the Huntley Lodge and chose this place for its central location. It's easy to just step out and find yourself in the center of everything.\n\nSince it was our first time at the Huntley and our first time in Big Sky, we wanted to check out everything they had to offer. The staff at the lodge were so friendly and helpful. Eric at the front desk was a wealth of information. Shortly after checking in, he called to ask how our room was. He was a wealth of fun suggestions of things to do at the lodge and beyond. The level of guest service Eric and the all the staff was outstanding and truly exceeded our expectations.\n\nThe trip seemed to fly by way too quickly. We took a ride to the top of Lone Peak. I highly recommend this place for getting photos that showcase Montana's beauty. We spent two days exploring Yellowstone and the last day we were so exhausted from exploring that we just stuck around the lodge, went swimming and relaxed before it was time to go home. We can't wait to return to Big Sky and can't wait to see what it's like during the winter season."

https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or20-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,"You’re on vacation, so go get a massage!!",Jun 2021 • Friends,"My parents and I were trying to plan something to do yesterday since we have just about done everything around the resort so we had a Spa Day! We all went to the spa/salon to get massages, I had Chancey for a deep tissue massage and she was FANTASTIC!! One of the best massages I’ve had in my life, I highly highly recommend if you’re feeling sore and tired from all the other fun activities this resort has!"
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or20-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,Outstanding Hotel Management Service,Apr 2021 • Family,"I have been coming to Big Sky since 1991. Absolutely my favorite Ski Destination. For the first time ever my Huntley Loft room was really unacceptable. To be fair the entire Huntley is being redone as I type and will be brand new next ski season. I went down to the desk and Cassie Carson Assistant Hotel Manager for Huntley Lodge was on duty. I began to explain my dissatisfaction and she had me sit with her and she listened. I was not angry and treated her as the Professional she is. She then offered me several solutions. In the end she moved us to a deluxe Shine with a view that was not a mistake. I was totally satisfied, but she then added a house credit for charges and extended additional considerations. Cassie in a word was a top notch professional who more than made up for the room condition. Big Sky Hotel Management has always been top notch but Cassie set a new Standard. Thanks Cassie for a great experience, also a shout out to Erica, and Sara Ann - really great at the front desk."
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or20-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,Better that Average,Apr 2021,"I skied in early April ... many of the on-mountain staff had ""taken the rest of the season"" off mentally ... they just weren't very active with lift/grooming/terrain-opening duties. Especially the trail status/grooming. Many groomed runs was not all the way groomed; not cool, this can get skiers/boarders injured! Several trails said open on the website but were roped-off when you went to ski them."
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or20-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,Great ski resort for all levels,Apr 2021 • Family,"This mountain has great, long trails for all skier levels. The runs over at the Six-shooter lift are about 2.5 miles long. Love it!\n\nThe Ramcharger lift and chairs are super cool with the padded heated seats!"
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or20-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,Excellent place to ski,Apr 2021 • Family,Love being here at big sky! The trails are so wide and there are so many trails with a huge variety of difficulty levels. It’s April so the crowds aren’t big so really no lines. It’s snowing too! Only complaint would be the lack of signs when you’re trying to get somewhere specific.
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or20-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,World class resort for avid skiers/riders.,Mar 2021,"Impressive ski resort, staggeringly beautiful mountain with tremendous terrain and challenge. I've been to many resorts in the Rockies, West Coast, Austria, and East Coast, and Big Sky is among the top 3. This was a family ski trip and we are strong, avid skiers/snowboarders, so we loved the bowls and the runs on the south side of Lone Peak (off the tram). However, for the casual skiing family, this is a big steep mountain, with limited grooming and a serious skier vibe. Although there are plenty of awesome greens and blues, this is a steep,advanced/expert -oriented mountain similar to Alta and Snowbird. (Take a good hard look at the trail map). We skied Deer Valley in January and were a little bored (although the service and grooming were appreciated and superb). Big Sky is a very different resort; the distinguishing features are the bowls, and the snowfields and chutes on Lone Peak. \nAt Big Sky, we skied 5 days the last week of March '21 and we enjoyed Spring conditions, followed by extreme Winter conditions and wind (resulting in boilerplate as bad as any on the East Coast), and then a return to beautiful Spring conditions. The grooming on the trails struggled to keep up, so we stayed in the bowls and the steeper North-facing aspects of the mountain which held adequate powder (see picture).\n \nWe are guilty of being Ikon pass-holders, and as I understand it, the Ikon pass has drawn many more skiers to Big Sky. Consequently, we did experience long lines at the mountain village lifts and on Powder Seeker. Also, the tram line can get quite long. However, there are lifts that service mostly tougher terrain that were always short (and shall remain nameless in this review). \nThe only serious complaint I have is a lack of signage --both trail signs and road signs. This lead to constant frustration, and two dangerous situations (one on Lone Peak and one on the road). Big Sky management: please spend some of that Ikon pass-holder money on a few more trail and road signs!\n\nOverall an absolutely top tier, world class ski resort particularly for skiers/riders that can enjoy the majority of the terrain. We can't wait to return!"
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or20-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,Greatest ski instructors ever!,Mar 2021 • Family,My kids were so fortunate to have ski lessons out of mountain village with Britt and Claudia! They learned so much and most importantly they had fun! Tom was wonderful coordinating everything along the way. Highly recommend!
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or20-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,"Reckless tourist skiers, no patrol or hosts keeping them in check",Mar 2021 • Family,"Nary a mountain host in sight to direct skiers, very few reminders of directions, slow zones, very little to no ski patrol visible on runs to remind people to ski in control. Two out of four people in my party were run over from behind by skiers on the same day. Second time was on a run that probably spanned five semis. An impact that broke my kids helmet. Of course a ticket says skiing is dangerous, I understand that part. However the downhill skier always has priority and any of us has an obligation to ski in control. In twenty years of skiing every week, I have never been hit by another skier. My reckless tourist comment is coming from a visitor! Reminders on lifts about safety or slow zones or ‘ski in control’ across runs help eliminate any confusion and this type of garbage skiing by visitors. Big Sky seems more concerned with maintaining the aesthetics than skier safety. I can’t recall even seeing a host or patroller out actually patrolling. Lots of terrain, just very little focus on maintaining skier safety on it."

This was our 4th trip to Big Sky. Lots of terrain. We generally go during the week to avoid weekend crowds.
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,Great views and terrific lifts,Dec 2021,"Big Sky Mountain was wonderful. The sights from the different trails are just gorgeous and the mountain did a good job of pushing people through. There were no lines at the lifts because they are able to get so many people up on the mountain so quickly. However, the rental lines were terrible. It took over an hour for my daughter to rent skis, boots and poles. It really slowed us down and could have been done so much more smoothly. Perhaps they just didn’t have enough staff. Overall, the mountain was wonderful though and the lodge was able to handle lots of people."

The staff was especially helpful, and it was a lot of fun to learn where each of them were from. Zuki helped us at breakfast and we just adored them. Grace helped us get checked in and true to her name, was super gracious throughout our stay. Anna Marie was a total delight to be around and helped us when we were confused and lost. We met Michael as he was tidying our room and he is the definition of a team member who goes ""above and beyond"" -- any hospitality group would be lucky to have him; I hope they see that and think about how he can grow with this organization. People could learn a lot from him. We hope other people get to benefit from their experience with these fine people and wonderful resort the way we did."

Let’s be fair and start with the pro shop staff. They were great. Then I was told to go down to the starter shack and I would be given a cart and my small bucket of balls. Nobody around for 10 mins so I grabbed both myself. Course was in pretty good shape so kudos to the grounds crew. Only issue was there were no signs letting you know what hole was what. On the back the cart paths cross cross a bit and with no signs I played the wrong hole. 16 instead of 11. Turned around and finished. Really wide open with few trees. Pretty coarse but should be $60 not the $80 I paid after 3pm. Includes cart. Play it but don’t expect too much.

I don't think they have ever vacuumed under the beds! Decor is very very dated, needs paints, carpet needs to be change etc., etc.. I do hope for the sake of Chet Huntley after whom this lodge is named for since it was his dream to build this resort (unfortunately passed away before it was completed), that renovations will be done to get it into a better state. No house cleaning service unless we asked for it and even then it was very bare minimal"
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,Great place EXCEPT whitewater inn,Aug 2021 • Family,"Basecamp has a lot of neat activities for kids- $45 to try them all was not exactly a steal, but our daughter had fun. The zip lining is amazing- so perfectly situated above the trees. Fair warning though- it’s quite a hike up, maybe 3/4 mile? It’s nice they include the chairlift with your stay. Pretty views. \n\nBUT whitewater inn is just NOT big sky resort. Not as nice or updated, way far out of the way (15 min drive plus parking and walking to the base), and certainly nowhere near the nice service. I wish I’d known this before booking, but I wasn’t at all familiar with the area or the levels of places to stay, so saying it here."

First time was in 2017 and we loved the massive terrain and non-existent lift lines. After visiting Park City, Deer Valley, Beaver Creek and Vail, we were excited to head back this year. Thought it would be the perfect place to avoid crowds especially with COVID. A lot has changed. Massive crowds at the base with longer lines at Ram Charger &amp; Swift Current than we encountered at the other resorts. Headed to the Moonlight side thinking may be less crowded over there. Six Shooter was just as bad most days with the line going uphill on both sides it was so long! Still love the beauty of Big Sky and the views of Lone Peak and the surrounding mountains are amazing. With that said, will likely wait until planned upgrades to their lifts occur before returning."

It won't be my last.\n\nI have wanted to come to Big Sky for years. I mad a point to make it happen this year.\n\nFirst, the resort was easy to get to. It is an hours drive from Bozeman International Airport. And the drive is very scenic. \n\nSecondly, the resort village is very accessible from our hotel.\n\nThird, lift lines were not terribly long.\n\nBig Sky Mountain is huge with lots of freshly groomed, skiable terrain. It is so spread out and uncrowded that often times, we didn't see very many people on the runs.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed Big Sky Ski resort."

https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or30-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,Great mountain but crowded lift lines,Mar 2021 • Couples,"Crowd was the least thing I expected to this Montana resort. But I was wrong. Its main lift, swift current express 4, desperately needs to be upgraded to dramatically increase the capacity. The planed 6-seat replacement next season will help but probably not be enough. The resort’s long term plan includes a 10-seat gondola parallel to this lift. It may take years to be done. \n\nThe mountain is vast and runs are well balanced between triple black diamond terrain and long green runs. The scenery is stunning. The snow is true Rocky Mountain powder. In general this is one the best ski mountains in North American. Hopefully it’s lift system can match the mountain soon. \n"

I think you could ski for a week and never experience the same run twice. Big Sky is a great family resort or retreat for friends or couples! Plenty of accommodations to choose from, including the luxury ski in ski out to the more off the beaten pass!!! \n"
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or30-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,Bid and FUN!,Mar 2021,"I was only able to spend 4 days at Big Sky. \nIt is so big that 4 days seems like a good start, but not a chsnce to ski every trail or even every part of the Resort. The Dakota Lift was not open when I was there, and it's like another whole ski area with a lot of runs, when it is open! \nLiberty Bowl is very accessible even to a beginner, if you exit on the catwalk at the top of the chairlift. The Yurt &amp; grill opens at 10:30 and ends at 3:30 PM - a good alternative for a food bresk without the croud at the Mountain Base. GO TO BIG SKY. It is really worth it."

Totally NUTZ. Too many people, too many out of control skiers, plus the beginners... and the straight lining yahoos trying to get somewhere. \n\n I did call customer service at Big Sky to suggest some control fencing on Fast Lane so we shall see what happens. \n\nBe safe everyone!"
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d107415-Reviews-or30-Big_Sky_Resort-Big_Sky_Montana.html,,Great Resort for Skiing,Feb 2021 • Family,"Checked off a box on my bucket list by skiing the West. We decided on Big Sky and we don’t regret it in any way. The skiable terrain is HUGE! We skied two days and didn’t come close to skiing everything we wanted to ski and we only skied the blue squares and the green circles. The advanced and expert runs were too challenging for our abilities but if you have that level of skill, I can’t imagine the amount of runs and the degree of challenge available would disappoint. Four mountains covered with an impressive number of lifts kept the lines quite reasonable, and many of times we had no wait at all, especially away from the resort’s main base area. We stayed in a condo a few miles down the road from the resort village, but did visit several shops and hotels, all of which measured up with expectations. We will be back!"

The food at the base area was really good, and they are friendly throughout. I really appreciated how they made me feel safe by being proactive about face masks and social distancing. Good job."
