# George Washington University - Data Analytics - Final Project

## Go-to Ski Resort Source

### 1. Introduction
Go-to Ski Resort is an application created to help Ski Resorts reduce the yearly issue of predicting the amount of natural snow and to be able to prepare for the ski season in two aspects:

* Projections of natural snow and projections of snowmaking conditions to determine the amount of snow the resort must make for the season.
 
* Initial measurement of the purchased ski gear and snowmaking supplies. 

### 2. Goal

To produce informative results for this case we will consider available sources of recreational and meteorological data and Machine Learning model to predict natural snow accumulation and project snowmaking for the season.

### 2.1. Select Datasets
First step in our work is to identify reliable recreational winter weather data to be paired with projected climate data and merge the information to a application to make business recomendation.
Select data for ski resort gear considering recreation activity (ski and snowborad), season lenght and monetization approach.

### 3. Results

Summarize results for a region, time and period and provide detailed baseline and future snow modeling for ski resorts
