# George Washington University - Data Analytics - Final Project

## Go-to Ski Resort Source

## 1. Introduction
Go-to Ski Resort is an application created to help Ski Resorts reduce the yearly issue of predicting the amount of natural snow and to be able to prepare for the ski season in two aspects:

* Projections of natural snow and projections of snowmaking conditions to determine the amount of snow the resort must make for the season.
 
* Initial measurement of the purchased ski gear and snowmaking supplies. 

## 2. Methods

To produce informative results for this case we will consider available sources of recreational and meteorological data to and Machine Learning to predict natural snow accumulation to project snowmaking model for the season.
First step in our work is to identify reliable recreational data to be paired with projected climate data and merge the information
